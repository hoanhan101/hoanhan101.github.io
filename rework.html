Today is a new reality where anyone can be in business. Informations are easy to access and within reach. It’s easy to work from home or collaborate with others across the globe. Stuff that was impossible is simple today. Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can’t control. Plans are guesses. Don’t be obsess you it. It’s OK to wing. Figure out what’s the next most important thing and do it. Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. As long as it’s sustainable and profitable, you should be proud. Working more doesn’t mean you get more done. Go. If you’re going to do something, do something that matters. To do great work, you need to feel you’re making a different, putting a meaningful dent in the universe, that you’re part of something important. You don’t have to cure cancer. You want your customer say it makes their lives better. You should feel an urgency too as you don’t live forever. Don’t wait for someone to make the changes you want to see. The easiest way to create a product/service is to make something you want to use. Solve your own problem first as you know what you need the most. Having the idea has nothing to do with actually making it. Start creating. Ideas are cheap, how you execute them are what matters. Perfect time never comes as you’re always too busy doing something else. Do it now. Always know why you’re doing what you’re doing. Stand for something and be proud of it. Avoid outside funding as much as you can. Service businesses don’t require much capital to bootstrap anyway. Taking people money means you have less control of your business and more human problem. You need less than you think. Stay lean. Be frugal. Think about profit from day one. Think about commitment strategy (how to grow and succeed), not exit strategy. Focus on getting customers to love you, not about worrying who’s going to buy you. Progress. Focus on the core product itself, ignore the details early on. Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Do it and reflect. Stick to the essential. Cut out unnecessary details, simplify, sort out what truly matters. Once your product does what it needs to do at the minimum, get it out there. Productivity. Start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction. Ensure that you’re doing work that matters? Why are you doing this? What is the problem, exactly? Is it actually useful? Is it adding value at all? Is there an easier way? What could you be doing instead? Is this really worth it? Interruption is the enemy of productivity. Avoid meetings as they’re unproductive most of the time. Only meet when: Have a set time. Invite as few people as possible. Have a clear agenda. Begin with a specific problem. End with a solution and implementation plan. When good enough gets the job done, go for it. You can usually turn good enough to great later. Build momentum by accomplishing small wins regularly. Have enough sleep everyday. Break your time frames into smaller chunks and estimate accordingly. Use a small todo list. Competitors. Don’t copy competitors since you don’t know their why. Instead, believe your way. Instead of trying to win a competitor, focus on quality (really good basic features) instead of quantities (more features). Don’t spend too much time worrying about competitors. Focus on improving yourself instead. Evolution. Learn to say no. Ask for feedbacks and ideas with enthusiasm but always evaluate the priority with a calm mind. Promotion. When it’s early, it’s easier to take risks without worrying about embarrassing yourself. Build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos, and so on. Share valuable information and slowly grow your fan. Get people interested in what you have to say. Teaching/sharing educational content is one of the best marketing tactics. Be genuine. Be transparent. Have personal, meaningful press releases instead of vague and generic ones. As long you have something to sell, don’t be afraid to give things away for free. Hiring. Do it yourself first to understand what it takes. Hire when you can’t do it no more. Pass on hiring people you don’t need. Hire slowly. How long someone’s been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well. Hire the best talent, regardless where it is.
