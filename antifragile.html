If a Black Swan event makes the risks pay off big, you profit handsomely. Practical activities: Lift heavy weights or do HIIT. Practice intermittent fasting. Eat fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, pickles,… Cold/heat exposure. Take cold showers, ice baths, wear less clothes and sleep only with your sheets. Take saunas, do Bikram yoga and get a sweat on during training. Put most of your money in safe investments and 10% in highly lucrative ones.
