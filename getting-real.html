Solve your problem. You know what’s is important and what’s not for the product itself. It’s likely people have the same problem so now you have a market too. Fund yourself Outside funding is plan B. Investors want their money back quickly → overhead + other complicated things follow. Money constraints force you to focus + allow creativity. Fix time and budget, flex scope: better to launch great thing, on time, on a budget in small scope than big ones with many holes. Pick up an enemy and use it as an motivation to tell better story. If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong. Stay lean. Simplify + focus. Lower the cost of change → change faster (huge advantage over big company). Start with 3 people: a developer, a designer, and a sweeper who can roam between both world. Work with your limited resources. Forget about VC, long release cycles, quick hires,… Stay small and friendly → get closer to customer. Priorities. What is the app vision? Why does it exit? What makes it different? Don’t get too deep in the details early one. Ship it first and optimize it later. Don’t waste time on problems you don’t have yet: Scaling to millions of users? Stop dreaming! Majority of apps are never going to reach that phase. Worry about it later once it’s wildly successful. Make decisions in time. Find the right audience. Narrow the market. Focus on the nice or small group of people who wants the product the most. Don’t try to please everyone. Make opinionated software, choose side, like every great companies (Apple, Google, Nitendo). Feature selection. What is the heart of the app? Forget milestone, TODO lists. Just focus on the essential. Let it gain traction. Then add to that foundation. Focus on what matters, REALLY. Cut off everything else. Learn to say no because you have to do that a lot. For every new feature, you need to: Say no. Force the feature to provide its value. If no, end. If yes, continue. Sketch the UI. Design the UI. Code. Test, tweak, repeat. Document. Market. Revisit pricing options, term of service. Launch. Build something that you can manage, organizationally, strategically, financially. Don’t worry too much about feature requests. Customers will constantly remind you about that. Ask customer what they don’t want too and simplify it if possible. Process. Get something real up and running quickly: it’s OK to do less, skip details, take shortcuts. Fail fast and learn. Avoid unproductive scheduling and action faking (doing bullshit works that feel “productive” that doesn’t get you closer to launching). Idea-to-implementation cycle. What does the app need to do? What exactly are you going to make? Sketch it out on paper. Create mock-up html screens. Code. Allowing options/preferences for customers is not necessarily helping them. If you make a bad call, they will complain, then you can fix it. Execute. Build momentum. Move on. Test in the wild. Get it out there. Get real results + feedback. Instead of having a beta version and a release version, have beta features in side the release one so you can have real data + workflow. Break it down into smaller problems and solve it one by one. Organization. Build a healthy organization. Utilize your alone time to get work done. Meetings are normally unproductive. Have fewer meetings. Only have it with a clear agenda. Release something today. Celebrate small victories. Staffing. Hire less, only when it’s really needed. Working with prospective employees on a real project can give a lot of insights. However, not everyone has time for that. Look at people codes + contribution on open-source projects. Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists. Go for happy one. Hire good writers because they know how to communicate. Interface. Design the interface before you start coding. Start from the core page and build outward. Focus on what matters. For each page, consider these 3 states: Blank: the screen before data is entered (could insert quick tutorials, help blurbs, examples with mock data,…) Regular: normal page Error: when shit happens It’s OK to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way Every letter matters. Don’t sound like an engineer talking to another engineer. Keep it short and sweet. Incorporate admin function into public interfaces so you don’t need to manage 2 different versions. Code. Keep it simple. But be mindful about technical debt. Less maintenance and support work. Low cost of change. Fewer bugs. Choose the tools that everyone is happy and productive with. Get data into the world via RSS, API,… Words. Document what is needed but nothing else. Write stories, not details. Don’t get into the technical/design details, just a quick story. Treat it as a normal conversation. Use real data if possible, not dummy text all the time → focus on the UX. What is your product’s personality type? Pricing and signup Give something for free. Let people experience and see its usefulness. Make signup and cancellation easy. Avoid long term contract, signup fee,… Promotion. Teaser (dropping hints), preview, launch. Build a promo site: overview, tour, screenshots, videos, manifesto, case studies, buzz (customers, press reviews,…), forum, pricing and signup, blog,… Blogging can be more effective (and cheaper) than advertising. Could write about advices, tips, tricks, links,… Start collecting emails asap. Share your knowledge. Teaching/educating is a great way to market yourself and your product too. Blog (as above). Speak at conferences. Conduct workshops. Give interviews. Write articles/books Track your online present. Leave comments, thank you notes, response to negative ones thoughtfully. Promote upgrade, in-app purchases. Pick an short, catchy, memorable name. Support. Feel the pain yourself. Don’t outsource. Learn from it. Use inline help and FAQ instead of giving manual training. Just response quickly even if you don’t have a perfect answer (during business hour). Also thank them for their input. Be willing to say no. Use forum or chat to let customers help each other. Be open, honest, transparent (yeah bad news). Post launch. Issue a major update 30 days after launch. Don’t stop blogging: new FAQs, tutorials, news, features, updates, fixes, buzz/press. Prioritize your bugs. Wait before the storm, 1-2 days after releasing a new feature and hearing complaints, then take action. Know your competitors. More mature doesn’t mean more complicated, as long as you provide valuable services that’s fine.
