            "content_text": " Table of Contents   We make decisions based on our unique experiences that make sense to us in a given moment.  Risk and luck are doppelgangers.  There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.  Even with a small starting base, compounding can lead to extraordinary results.  Getting wealthy and staying wealthy are two different skills.  You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.  The highest form of wealth is freedom.  Humility, kindness, empathy will bring you respect, not fancy things.  Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns and lots to do with your saving rate.  Things that have never happened before happen all the time.  Always leave room for errors.  People are poor forecasters of their future selves.  Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.  Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are.  Financial pessimism is easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism.  Stories are the most powerful force in the economy.We make decisions based on our unique experiences that make sense to us in a given moment.We all come from different generations, backgrounds and have our own unique experience with how the world works. What seems crazy to other people might make sense to you. For example:  Stocks: If you were born in 1970, the S&amp;P 500 increased almost 10-fold during your 20s. However, if you were born in 1950, the market had only about 0-2x returns in your 20s.  Lottery tickets: The lowest income households in the US spend 4 more times of those in highest income group per year. If you’re not in the lowest income group, it seems crazy to you. However, they live paycheck to paycheck, can’t afford most things but are hopeful for a life-changing dream. To them, the definition of being wealthy is the life you’re taking for granted.  Working condition of Foxconn: For American, it was long hours, small wage, poor working condition. For Chinese workers, it was an improvement as they would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss rather than having their bodies be exploited by several men for pennies (prostitution).Risk and luck are doppelgangers.Let’s talk about Bill Gates. He went to Lakeside, one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer. Additionally, most university graduate school did not have a computer as advanced as he had in 8th grade. Then, he and Paul Allen was obsessed with it, spent night and weekends hacking. They were smart, curious, hardworking, and ambitious. Now, Kent Evans was Bill’s best friend. He was smart, had business mind and endless ambition. He could be a founding partner with Gates and Allen but it would never happen because he died in a mountaineering accident. While Bill experienced one in a million luck by ending up at Lakeside, Kent experienced one in a million risk - the odd of being killed on a mountain in high school. Both are hard to measure, accept, that they often overlooked.While luck actually plays a role in financial success, it’s hard to quantify it and rude to suggest people’s success is owed to it. On the other side, failure is equally overlooked. Say I buy a stock and 5 years later its’ gone nowhere. Now, it’s possible that I made a good decision that has 80% chance of making money but I happen to end up on the unfortunate 20%. Just as with luck, failure is too complex to pick apart how much of an outcome is a conscious decision versus a risk. They are doppelgangers:  Benjamin Graham’s investing success was due to owning an enormous chunk of GEICO stock which broke nearly every diversification rule that he laid out in his famous text.  People praised Mark Zuckerberg for turning down Yahoo’s offer to buy his company but criticized Yahoo with as much passion for turning down Microsoft’s offer.  “The customer is always right” and “customers don’t know what they want” are both accepted business wisdom.  Not all success is due to hard work and not all failure is due to laziness.When things are going well, it’s not as good as you think and vice versa. Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.Rajat Gupta and Bernie Madoff had everything, wealth, prestige, power, freedom, before they committed crimes. Long-Term Capital Management took so much risk that they managed to lose everything. They threw it all away because they wanted more.  “Warren Buffett later put it: To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense.”Now, at some point in your life, you will have a sum of money sufficient to cover every reasonable things you need and want, remember a few things:  The hardest skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. It gets dangerous when the taste of having more money, power, increases ambition faster than satisfaction.  Social comparison is the problem. Top hedge fund mangers could look ahead to Warren Buffet while he could ahead to Jeff Bezos. It’s the battle that can never be won. The only way is not to fight in the first place and accept that you might have enough.  Enough is realizing that the opposite will push you to the point of regret. For example, you can eat more than enough or until you’re sick. In business, it could mean burning out or risky investments you can’t maintain.  There are things that never worth risking, such as reputation, freedom, family and friends, happiness.Even with a small starting base, compounding can lead to extraordinary results.  “More than 2,000 books are dedicated to how Warren Buffett built his fortune. Many of them are wonderful. But few pay enough attention to the simplest fact: Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor since he was literally a child.”Buffet is the richest investor of all time, not the greatest when measured by average annual return. Jim Simons, has compounded money at 66% annually since 1988 while Buffet’s is at 22%. However, Jim’s net worth is not as big as Buffet because he’s had less than haft as many years to compound as Buffet. That said, Buffet’s secret is compound interest with time. He’s been investing consistently for 3 quarters of a century.Compound isn’t always intuitive and we often ignore its potential. Plus, good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest return because the highest one tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning a pretty good return which you can stick with for the longest period of time and let the compounding runs wild.Getting wealthy and staying wealthy are two different skills.Getting wealthy requires taking risks and being optimistic while staying wealthy requires the opposite of taking risk:  Fear: what you’ve made can be taken away just as fast.  Frugality: accepting that at least some of your wealth is attributable to luck and past success can’t be repeat indefinitely.  “Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital, mentioned longevity, noting that some VC firms succeed for five or ten years, but Sequoia has prospered for four decades: I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business. We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune.”Survival mentality is the key with money for 2 reasons:  Few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over.  Compounding only works if you can give an asset years to grow.Applying the survival mentality comes down to 3 things:  More than big returns, you want to be financially unbreakable so that you’ll able to stick around long enough for compounding returns. Good returns sustain uninterrupted for the longest period of time, especially in times of chaos and havoc.  Have a plan that can survive reality, allowing room for errors. If there’s enough room for error in your saving rates that you can say: It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years but if it only does 4%, I’ll still be OK.  Be optimistic about the future, the long-term growth is up but equally be sure that the road between now and then is filled with misery, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome.You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.By 1990s and 2000, Heinz Berggruen became one of the most successful art dealers of all time by selling parts of his massive collection of Picassos, Braques, Klees,… to the German government. He bought everything he could, in portfolios not individual pieces he happened to like, waited for a few winner to emerge. 99% of the work turned out to be of little of value. However, 1% turned out to be the work of someone like Picasso. He could be wrong most of the time but still ended up right.  “It is not intuitive that an investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.”Anything that is huge, profitable, influential is the result of a long-tail event. Take venture capital for example. A VC makes 50 investments, expects half to fail, 10 to make 10-20x return, 1-2 to make 50x or more. This is actually the same for large public companies as most of them are duds, a few do well, and a handful become extraordinary that account for the majority of the market’s return. It’s the tails that drive everything.So what should you do right now? What stocks should you buy today? Well, it doesn’t matter. Over the course of your lifetime, your decision that you make today, tomorrow or next week will not matter as much as what you do during the small number of days when everyone around is going crazy. For example, if you invest $1 consistently from 1900 to 2019, whether it’s a recession or bear market, you could end up with the most money compared to whom invest only when a recession ends or sells when a recession begins. You can fail a lot of times but still end up making more since each stock’s return is not equal to each other. Warren Buffet owned 400-500 stocks but made most of his money on 10 of them.  “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.”The highest form of wealth is freedom.It’s the ability to wake up everyday and do whatever you want, when you want, with whom you want, for as long as you want.The common denominator in happiness is that people want to control their lives. Money has the ability to give you that control. Building wealth means the ability to take a few days of work without breaking the bank, having shorter commute, dealing with a medical emergency without the added burden of worrying about how you’ll pay for it and eventually retiring when you want to.Humility, kindness, empathy will bring you respect, not fancy things.  “People tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.”People generally aspire to be respected and admired by others. Using money to buy fancy things might bring less of it than you imagine. Instead, humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than any fast cars ever will.Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns and lots to do with your saving rate.Investment returns can make you rich but whether it will work and how long it will work for is always in doubt. Personal savings and frugality are more in your control. Also, the value of wealth is relative to what you need. Say you and I have the same net worth. You are a better investor since you earn 12% annual returns while I only earn 8%. However, I’m more efficient with my money since I need half as much to be happy while your lifestyle compounds as fast as your assets.Less ego, more wealth.Things that have never happened before happen all the time.History offers a rough guide of what tends to work and what not. But it’s not a map of the future. Two dangerous things happen when you reply too heavily on investment history as a guide to what happen next:  The most important events are not yet happened and they are what move the needle in the economy the most.  History can be misleading because it might not be relevant in today’s world. VC barely existed 25 years ago. Thee S&amp;P 500 did not include financial stock until 1976. Technology stock were nonexistent 50 years ago. The Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest books of all time even though most of its advices do not work in today’s time.You can plan for every risk except ones that are too crazy to cross your mind. Those crazy things can do the most harm and they happen more frequently than you think.Always leave room for errors.  “The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance, “unknowns”, are an ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day.”Benjamin Graham calls it margin of safety, or room for errors. Instead of viewing the word as black or white, predictable or a crapshoot, view it as a gray area and pursue things where a range of potential outcomes are acceptable. It’s often misunderstood as a conservative move, used by those who don’t want to take much risk. However, when room for errors is used appropriately, it lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your favor. The biggest gains happen infrequently either because they don’t happen often or they take time to compound.  “Bill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young company, he said he “came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get any payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar idea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008: “I have pledged—to you, the rating agencies and myself—to always run Berkshire with more than ample cash … When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.”In short, you have to take risk to get ahead but no risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. Not only an event of wiping out leaves you broke, it also erases every opportunity to get back in the game at the moment opportunity is ripe. Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.People are poor forecasters of their future selves.Imagine a goal is easy and fun. Imagine a goal in the context of life stresses is different. For example, a five-year-old boy wants to drive a tractor when he grows up but then realizes later that it isn’t the best career. He wants something more lucrative, like a lawyer. He then faces such long working hours that he rarely sees his family. He wants to take a lower-paying job with flexible hours. However, childcare is expensive so he becomes a stay-at-home father. At age 70, he realizes that he’s not prepared to afford retirement.Things change as your goals and desires. It’s hard to make enduring long-term decisions when your view can shift. So then, how do you apply the compounding rule? How do you not interrupt your investment when what you want changes? How do we listen to Buffet to keep doing the same thing for decades and let the compounding runs wild then? There is no easy solution, but keep in mind these 2 things:  When you consider your tendency to change over time, at every point of your life, avoid future regret and encourage endurance by avoiding the extreme ends. Aim to have moderate annual saving, moderate free time, moderate time with family and so on.  Accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible. Don’t let old decision make you prisoner to your past.Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.The S&amp;P 500 increased 119-fold in the 50 years ending 2018. All you had to do was sit back and let your money compound. But is it easy? Do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing? It looks easy when you’re not the one doing it. Sometimes, this is because we’re overconfident. Most of the time, we’re not good at identifying the price of success, which prevents us from being able to pay it.The price of successful investing is accepting volatility and upheaval. You can find an asset with less uncertainty and a lower payoff, or attempt to perform tricks to get the return without paying the price by selling before the next recession and buying before the boom. However, sometimes you get away with it, sometimes you get caught.Why is it so hard? Because the price of successful investing is not immediately obvious. Market volatility feels like a fine that you should avoid. However, a trick is to view it like an entrance fee that you have to pay to enter. It’s worth paying in order to expect good returns.Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are.How much should you pay for Google stock today? Are you looking to cash out within:  30 years: Analyze Google’s discounted cash flows over the next 30 years.  10 years: Analyze the tech industry over the next decade and whether Google can execute its vision.  1 year: Pay attention to Google’s current product sale cycles and whether we’ll have a bear market.When investors have different goals and time horizon, prices that look crazy to one person can make sense to another. Take a look at Yahoo’s stock in the dotcom bubble 1999. To many short-term investors, it made sense for them to pay for a ridiculously high price. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term. In other words, bubbles are not about valuation rising but time horizon sinking as more short-term traders enter the field. They were not thinking about the next 20 years but the next days or months. They were not irrational or irresponsible at all. Matter of facts, they were really rational about chasing short-term gains. However, this created problem for long-term investors. The price was high, other people were buying it so they thought it was smart to go along. Unfortunately, it was too expensive to enter and hold for the long run.Again, make sure you know what game you’re playing. Do not be persuaded by the actions and behaviours of people playing different games than you are.Financial pessimism is easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism.  “If a smart person tells me they have a stock pick that’s going to rise 10-fold in the next year, I will immediately write them off as full of nonsense. If someone who’s full of nonsense tells me that a stock I own is about to collapse because it’s an accounting fraud, I will clear my calendar and listen to their every word. Say we’ll have a big recession and newspapers will call you. Say we’re headed for average growth and no one particularly cares. Say we’re nearing the next Great Depression and you’ll get on TV. But mention that good times are ahead, or markets have room to run, or that a company has huge potential, and a common reaction from commentators and spectators alike is that you are either a salesman or comically aloof of risks.”There is a couple of reasons why financial pessimism is easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism:  Money is ubiquitous as a recession could impact every single person.  Assuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easy forecast to make and persuasive because it doesn’t imagining the world changing and people adapting.  Progress happens too slowly to notice (years long) while setbacks and failures happen to quickly to ignore (overnight).Stories are the most powerful force in the economy.The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. Especially, when you desperately need a solution and a good one isn’t known or readily available to you, you will believe anything. People listen to investment commentaries and financial advices that have little track record of success because they want to believe that 1% chance will come true and change their lives. In hindsight, Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was obvious. However, he told a good story and people wanted to believe it. If you want a certain stock to return 10x, you’re more likely to believe that’s true. So be aware. Make sure you leave room for errors.Everyone has an incomplete view of the world but we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps. The ability to explain the past/history gives us an illusion that the world is understandable, even when it doesn’t make sense. When a stock rises you might an explanation for it but that might not necessarily true. Your ability to predict recessions isn’t much better. However, there’s still tremendous demand for forecasts because we need to believe we live in a predicable world.References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money",

However, Jim’s net worth is not as big as Buffet because he’s had less than haft as many years to compound as Buffet. That said, Buffet’s secret is compound interest with time. He’s been investing consistently for 3 quarters of a century.</p><p>Compound isn’t always intuitive and we often ignore its potential. Plus, good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest return because the highest one tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning a pretty good return which you can stick with for the longest period of time and let the compounding runs wild.</p><h2 id=\"getting-wealthy-and-staying-wealthy-are-two-different-skills\">Getting wealthy and staying wealthy are two different skills.</h2><p>Getting wealthy requires taking risks and being optimistic while staying wealthy requires the opposite of taking risk:</p><ul>  <li>Fear: what you’ve made can be taken away just as fast.</li>  <li>Frugality: accepting that at least some of your wealth is attributable to luck and past success can’t be repeat indefinitely.</li></ul><blockquote>  <p>“Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital, mentioned longevity, noting that some VC firms succeed for five or ten years, but Sequoia has prospered for four decades: I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business. We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune.”</p></blockquote><p>Survival mentality is the key with money for 2 reasons:</p><ul>  <li>Few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over.</li>  <li>Compounding only works if you can give an asset years to grow.</li></ul><p>Applying the survival mentality comes down to 3 things:</p><ul>  <li>More than big returns, you want to be financially unbreakable so that you’ll able to stick around long enough for compounding returns. Good returns sustain uninterrupted for the longest period of time, especially in times of chaos and havoc.</li>  <li>Have a plan that can survive reality, allowing room for errors. If there’s enough room for error in your saving rates that you can say: It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years but if it only does 4%, I’ll still be OK.</li>  <li>Be optimistic about the future, the long-term growth is up but equally be sure that the road between now and then is filled with misery, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome.</li></ul><h2 id=\"you-can-be-wrong-half-the-time-and-still-make-a-fortune\">You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.</h2><p>By 1990s and 2000, Heinz Berggruen became one of the most successful art dealers of all time by selling parts of his massive collection of Picassos, Braques, Klees,… to the German government. He bought everything he could, in portfolios not individual pieces he happened to like, waited for a few winner to emerge. 99% of the work turned out to be of little of value. However, 1% turned out to be the work of someone like Picasso. He could be wrong most of the time but still ended up right.</p><blockquote>  <p>“It is not intuitive that an investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.”</p></blockquote><p>Anything that is huge, profitable, influential is the result of a long-tail event. Take venture capital for example. A VC makes 50 investments, expects half to fail, 10 to make 10-20x return, 1-2 to make 50x or more. This is actually the same for large public companies as most of them are duds, a few do well, and a handful become extraordinary that account for the majority of the market’s return. It’s the tails that drive everything.</p><p>So what should you do right now? What stocks should you buy today? Well, it doesn’t matter. Over the course of your lifetime, your decision that you make today, tomorrow or next week will not matter as much as what you do during the small number of days when everyone around is going crazy. For example, if you invest $1 consistently from 1900 to 2019, whether it’s a recession or bear market, you could end up with the most money compared to whom invest only when a recession ends or sells when a recession begins. You can fail a lot of times but still end up making more since each stock’s return is not equal to each other. Warren Buffet owned 400-500 stocks but made most of his money on 10 of them.</p><blockquote>  <p>“It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.”</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-highest-form-of-wealth-is-freedom\">The highest form of wealth is freedom.</h2><p>It’s the ability to wake up everyday and do whatever you want, when you want, with whom you want, for as long as you want.</p><p>The common denominator in happiness is that people want to control their lives. Money has the ability to give you that control. Building wealth means the ability to take a few days of work without breaking the bank, having shorter commute, dealing with a medical emergency without the added burden of worrying about how you’ll pay for it and eventually retiring when you want to.</p><h2 id=\"humility-kindness-empathy-will-bring-you-respect-not-fancy-things\">Humility, kindness, empathy will bring you respect, not fancy things.</h2><blockquote>  <p>“People tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.”</p></blockquote><p>People generally aspire to be respected and admired by others. Using money to buy fancy things might bring less of it than you imagine. Instead, humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than any fast cars ever will.</p><h2 id=\"building-wealth-has-little-to-do-with-your-income-or-investment-returns-and-lots-to-do-with-your-saving-rate\">Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns and lots to do with your saving rate.</h2><p>Investment returns can make you rich but whether it will work and how long it will work for is always in doubt. Personal savings and frugality are more in your control. Also, the value of wealth is relative to what you need. Say you and I have the same net worth. You are a better investor since you earn 12% annual returns while I only earn 8%. However, I’m more efficient with my money since I need half as much to be happy while your lifestyle compounds as fast as your assets.</p><p>Less ego, more wealth.</p><h2 id=\"things-that-have-never-happened-before-happen-all-the-time\">Things that have never happened before happen all the time.</h2><p>History offers a rough guide of what tends to work and what not. But it’s not a map of the future. Two dangerous things happen when you reply too heavily on investment history as a guide to what happen next:</p><ul>  <li>The most important events are not yet happened and they are what move the needle in the economy the most.</li>  <li>History can be misleading because it might not be relevant in today’s world. VC barely existed 25 years ago. Thee S&amp;P 500 did not include financial stock until 1976. Technology stock were nonexistent 50 years ago. The Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest books of all time even though most of its advices do not work in today’s time.</li></ul><p>You can plan for every risk except ones that are too crazy to cross your mind. Those crazy things can do the most harm and they happen more frequently than you think.</p><h2 id=\"always-leave-room-for-errors\">Always leave room for errors.</h2><blockquote>  <p>“The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance, “unknowns”, are an ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day.”</p></blockquote><p>Benjamin Graham calls it margin of safety, or room for errors. Instead of viewing the word as black or white, predictable or a crapshoot, view it as a gray area and pursue things where a range of potential outcomes are acceptable. It’s often misunderstood as a conservative move, used by those who don’t want to take much risk. However, when room for errors is used appropriately, it lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your favor. The biggest gains happen infrequently either because they don’t happen often or they take time to compound.</p><blockquote>  <p>“Bill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young company, he said he “came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get any payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar idea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008: “I have pledged—to you, the rating agencies and myself—to always run Berkshire with more than ample cash … When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.”</p></blockquote><p>In short, you have to take risk to get ahead but no risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. Not only an event of wiping out leaves you broke, it also erases every opportunity to get back in the game at the moment opportunity is ripe. Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.</p><h2 id=\"people-are-poor-forecasters-of-their-future-selves\">People are poor forecasters of their future selves.</h2><p>Imagine a goal is easy and fun. Imagine a goal in the context of life stresses is different. For example, a five-year-old boy wants to drive a tractor when he grows up but then realizes later that it isn’t the best career. He wants something more lucrative, like a lawyer. He then faces such long working hours that he rarely sees his family. He wants to take a lower-paying job with flexible hours. However, childcare is expensive so he becomes a stay-at-home father. At age 70, he realizes that he’s not prepared to afford retirement.</p><p>Things change as your goals and desires. It’s hard to make enduring long-term decisions when your view can shift. So then, how do you apply the compounding rule? How do you not interrupt your investment when what you want changes? How do we listen to Buffet to keep doing the same thing for decades and let the compounding runs wild then? There is no easy solution, but keep in mind these 2 things:</p><ul>  <li>When you consider your tendency to change over time, at every point of your life, avoid future regret and encourage endurance by avoiding the extreme ends. Aim to have moderate annual saving, moderate free time, moderate time with family and so on.</li>  <li>Accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible. Don’t let old decision make you prisoner to your past.</li></ul><h2 id=\"every-job-looks-easy-when-youre-not-the-one-doing-it\">Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.</h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 increased 119-fold in the 50 years ending 2018. All you had to do was sit back and let your money compound. But is it easy? Do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing? It looks easy when you’re not the one doing it. Sometimes, this is because we’re overconfident. Most of the time, we’re not good at identifying the price of success, which prevents us from being able to pay it.</p><p>The price of successful investing is accepting volatility and upheaval. You can find an asset with less uncertainty and a lower payoff, or attempt to perform tricks to get the return without paying the price by selling before the next recession and buying before the boom. However, sometimes you get away with it, sometimes you get caught.</p><p>Why is it so hard? Because the price of successful investing is not immediately obvious. Market volatility feels like a fine that you should avoid. However, a trick is to view it like an entrance fee that you have to pay to enter. It’s worth paying in order to expect good returns.</p><h2 id=\"investors-often-innocently-take-cues-from-other-investors-who-are-playing-a-different-game-than-they-are\">Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are.</h2><p>How much should you pay for Google stock today? Are you looking to cash out within:</p><ul>  <li>30 years: Analyze Google’s discounted cash flows over the next 30 years.</li>  <li>10 years: Analyze the tech industry over the next decade and whether Google can execute its vision.</li>  <li>1 year: Pay attention to Google’s current product sale cycles and whether we’ll have a bear market.</li></ul><p>When investors have different goals and time horizon, prices that look crazy to one person can make sense to another. Take a look at Yahoo’s stock in the dotcom bubble 1999. To many short-term investors, it made sense for them to pay for a ridiculously high price. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term. In other words, bubbles are not about valuation rising but time horizon sinking as more short-term traders enter the field. They were not thinking about the next 20 years but the next days or months. They were not irrational or irresponsible at all. Matter of facts, they were really rational about chasing short-term gains. However, this created problem for long-term investors. The price was high, other people were buying it so they thought it was smart to go along. Unfortunately, it was too expensive to enter and hold for the long run.</p><p>Again, make sure you know what game you’re playing. Do not be persuaded by the actions and behaviours of people playing different games than you are.</p><h2 id=\"financial-pessimism-is-easy-common-and-more-persuasive-than-optimism\">Financial pessimism is easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism.</h2><blockquote>  <p>“If a smart person tells me they have a stock pick that’s going to rise 10-fold in the next year, I will immediately write them off as full of nonsense. If someone who’s full of nonsense tells me that a stock I own is about to collapse because it’s an accounting fraud, I will clear my calendar and listen to their every word. Say we’ll have a big recession and newspapers will call you. Say we’re headed for average growth and no one particularly cares. Say we’re nearing the next Great Depression and you’ll get on TV. But mention that good times are ahead, or markets have room to run, or that a company has huge potential, and a common reaction from commentators and spectators alike is that you are either a salesman or comically aloof of risks.”</p></blockquote><p>There is a couple of reasons why financial pessimism is easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism:</p><ul>  <li>Money is ubiquitous as a recession could impact every single person.</li>  <li>Assuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easy forecast to make and persuasive because it doesn’t imagining the world changing and people adapting.</li>  <li>Progress happens too slowly to notice (years long) while setbacks and failures happen to quickly to ignore (overnight).</li></ul><h2 id=\"stories-are-the-most-powerful-force-in-the-economy\">Stories are the most powerful force in the economy.</h2><p>The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. Especially, when you desperately need a solution and a good one isn’t known or readily available to you, you will believe anything. People listen to investment commentaries and financial advices that have little track record of success because they want to believe that 1% chance will come true and change their lives. In hindsight, Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was obvious. However, he told a good story and people wanted to believe it. If you want a certain stock to return 10x, you’re more likely to believe that’s true. So be aware. Make sure you leave room for errors.</p><p>Everyone has an incomplete view of the world but we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps. The ability to explain the past/history gives us an illusion that the world is understandable, even when it doesn’t make sense. When a stock rises you might an explanation for it but that might not necessarily true. Your ability to predict recessions isn’t much better. However, there’s still tremendous demand for forecasts because we need to believe we live in a predicable world.</p><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money</a></li></ul>",

The purpose of wealth is freedom. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want anymore. You can get up or sleep whenever you want, live anywhere you want, pursue anything you want.Money is how we transfer wealth, not wealth itself. It’s social credits, meaning that if you create value for society, you get paid by credits, which is money in the case. In other word, money is a medium of exchange.Make abundance for the worldWealth isn’t about taking money or something from somebody else but creating abundance. Make something lots of people want.  Everybody can be wealthy. Everybody can be retired. Everybody can be successful. It is merely a question of education and desire. You have to want it. If you don’t want it, that’s fine. Then you opt out of the game.For example, the thing that makes Bitcoin interesting is not that it’s the best technology but it has the most diehard fan out there. As long as there are believers, like a movement or a religion, it’s a currency. If the world decide that Bitcoin is better than US dollars, it would switch to Bitcoin. It’s a consensus belief.Making money isn’t about luckThere are 4 kinds of luck:  Blind luck: you get lucky because something completely out of your control happens.  Luck from hustling: luck that comes through persistence, hard work, hustle.  Luck from preparation: if you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in that field.  Luck from your unique character: you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.The first 3 kinds are clear. The 4th one, it’s about becoming the kind of person that makes money. You create your own luck, build your character so opportunity finds you.  If you’re a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term thinking deal maker, then when other people want to do deals but they don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the integrity and reputation that you have built up. Warren Buffett, he gets offered deals, and he gets to buy companies, and he gets to buy warrants, and bailout banks and do things that other people can’t do because of his reputation.You won’t get rich renting out your timeIn most salaried job, even at one that’s paying a lot per hour like a doctor, you’re still getting paid by the hours. When you’re sleeping, retired, or on vacation, you’re not earning. That means:  Your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs.  You not creating that much original for society.  You’re essentially replaceable by robots or AI because you’re doing a set role.You want a job, or a career, or a profession where your inputs don’t match your outputs, where you can put 1 hour of work that can produce 100x output. For example, a great engineer can create bitcoin and that is billions of dollars worth of value. Another way of saying is to look for things that are leveraged. Using the same example, a computer is a tool that software engineers use to get leverage. A lumberjack that uses robots for help can be more efficient than someone using their bare hands.  So everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you can be working at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. They’re in an investment firm, and they’re buying equity. These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours.Live below your meansWhen you become a bit more wealthy, you don’t want to upgrade your lifestyle too fast. Ideally you want to make your money in discrete lumps, separated over long periods of time so that your lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly.Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get at scaleAlmost everything that you own used to be technology at one point in time and made someone rich. Oil was a technology that made Rockefeller rich. Cars were technology that made Ford rich. Once technology works, or becomes mainstream, it’s no longer technology. That said, you want to figure out what thing or technology per say, you can provide for society that it doesn’t know how to get yet. Then you have to figure out how to scale it to millions, billions of them so that everyone can have one. In other words, you’re bringing the high end to the mass market. First you create it because you want it and know how to build it. Once you’ve built it for yourself, figure out how to get it to other in a profitable way.The internet allows you to scale any niche obsessionYou can find your audience on the internet, on any niche, build a business, create a product, and build wealth as long as you’re the best at it to scale out. The more authentic you are, the less competition you’re gonna have. No one can compete with you on being you.  The space of careers has been so broadened. E-sports players, you know, people making millions of dollars playing Fortnite. People creating videos, and uploading them. YouTube broadcasters. Bloggers, podcasters. Joe Rogan, I read, true or false, I don’t know, but I read that he’s gonna make about $100 million a year on his podcast. And he’s had 2 billion downloads.All returns in life come from compound interest in long-term gamesWhat industries should you work in? What kind of job should you should have? Who do you might want to work with? Pick one where you can play long-term games with long-term people because they’re good with compound interest and with trust. In a long-term game, everyone is making each other rich while in a short-term one, they are making themselves rich.Not just wealth but all returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. A good hack is to find the thing that feel like playing to you (but work to other) that you can do long term. For example, you can find a healthy food that you enjoy and eat them regularly. You can find an good exercise routine that you can do every day or every other day so that it becomes a part of your life. Hacking on some code that you enjoy is more productive than playing video games. That said, finding the things that make the long term feel effortless to you is the key to winning.Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrityYou can’t compromise on any of these 3:  They need to be smart (at different things), or they’ll go in the wrong direction.  They need to be high-energy/motivated because the world is full of smart, lazy people. That motivation, however, has to come intrinsically.  They need to be high-integrity or they’ll cheat you.Be a rational optimistBeing rational is when you know all the pitfalls, upsides, downsides. Being optimistic is when you look up to every possibility, know your capabilities get things done and you have a strong action bias. Before deciding if an idea is viable or not, do it first, test it out.Arm yourself with specific knowledgeSpecific knowledge can’t be trained. If you can be trained for it, then someone else can be trained for it too. If you’re replaceable, you get paid by minimum wage because there are lots of other who can do the same thing as you.Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your innate talents, genuine curiosity, and passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job or going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.  My whole value system was built around scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things, talking to people. So, I have some sales skills, which is a form specific knowledge that I have. I have some analytical skills around how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. I also just love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships. The classic example is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free.Specific knowledge is often highly creative or technical. Scott Adams is a good example of this where he is really good at making predictions through persuasive arguments and videos.  And that is specific knowledge that he has built up over the years because he got obsessed with hypnosis when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he embraced Periscope early, so he’s been practicing lots of conversation, he’s read all the books on the topic, he’s employed it in his everyday life.A pragmatic approach to build up specific knowledge is to become top 5 at three or more things. It’s important that you also pick things where you are a natural, that you enjoy and makes you unique.Learn to sell, learn to buildBuilding the product can include design, development, manufacturing, operating and so on. Selling it can include marketing, communicating, raising money and so on. Generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best where you have two founders, one is world class at selling, and the other is world class at building. It’s the magic combination.Start out with a building mentality and learn selling later because it’s harder otherwise. Sales skills could mean in different than traditional domain. For example, you are an engineer. You might not good at hand-to-hand sales but you’re a good communicator that can leverage it for your sales. You might not good at writing but you’re good at recruiting or fundraising.Read what you love until you love to readThe foundation of learning is reading. No smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.To read more, develop a love for reading. To do that, read books that you love. Just read the things that interest you until reading becomes a habit.It is important to read foundational books, the original one in a given field that are very scientific in their nature. Build up a solid foundation so that you don’t fear anything. You can just take any book in the library, read and understand it.  For example, instead of reading a business book, pick up Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Instead of reading a book on biology or evolution that’s written today, I would pick up Darwin’s Origin of the Species. Instead of reading a book on biotech right now that may be very advanced, I would just pick up The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. Instead of reading advanced books on what cosmology and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you can pick up Richard Feynman’s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.Also learn computer programming.  I would say that the five most important skills are of course, reading, writing, arithmetic, and then as you’re adding in, persuasion, which is talking. And then finally, I would add computer programming just because it’s an applied form of arithmetic that just gets you so much leverage for free in any domain that you operate in. If you’re good with computers, if you’re good at basic mathematics, if you’re good at writing, if you’re good at speaking, and if you like reading, you’re set for life.There’s no actual skill called ‘business’  A lot of what goes on in business schools, and there is some very intelligent stuff taught in business schools – I don’t mean to detract from them completely – some of the things taught in business school are just anecdotes. They call them “case studies.” But they’re just anecdotes, and they’re trying to help you pattern match by throwing lots of data points at you, but the reality is, you will never understand them fully until you’re actually in that position yourself.You can’t learn about running a business by watching others do it or studying/reading about others doing it. You can only learn by operating your own business, even opening your own lemonade stand or a retail store. However, you have to be careful about how you do it. If you start a business where you’re doing the same thing everyday, you’re not learning that much. Instead of putting in thousands of hours doing the same thing, you want to put in thousands of iterations to experiment, validate, test your idea. Of course doing something new is painful and you could lose money, be stressed out but you have to get very comfortable with frequent small failures. When you win, you’ll win big. On average, you’ll make more.  Nassim Taleb talks about this also. He made his fortune, his wealth by being a trader who basically relied upon black swans. Nassim Taleb made money by losing little bits of money every day and then once in a blue moon he would make a lot of money when the unthinkable happened for other people.You need accountability to get leverageTo get rich, you need to get leverage, which can come from labor (somebody works for you), capital (somebody gives you money), or code or media. To get these things, you need to build up credibility by building these under your own name. Having accountability allows you to take credit when things go well but also take risk of failure, humiliation. You’re taking greater downside risk for greater upside. That is not bad in reality because even if you fail in public, you actually gain a lot of power. Look at people like Kanye, Oprah, Elon. They sometime fail big but they’re are still very wealthy and powerful because their name are such powerful brandings.Plus, you’re less replaceable if you have high accountability.Labor and capital are old leverageLabor is the oldest form, which is people working for you, though it’s the worst one for two reasons. One, managing people requires tremendous leadership skills. Two, it’s incredibly competed over as people fight really hard to win. That said, you want to stay out of this or use it as little as possible.Capital is more modern, which is people moving large amounts of money around. It’s the dominant one that people have used to get extremely wealthy in the last century. It’s powerful. It can be converted to labor as well as other things. It scales well. The hard thing is obtain it. If you have specific knowledge and high accountability in a domain, people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage so you can go get more capital.Product and media are new leverageThe most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. You can multiply your efforts without having to involve labor or capital. It was invented in the last 100 years, starting with printing press, accelerating with broadcast media, and now blowing up with Internet and coding.Product and media leverage are permissionless in a sense that you don’t need anyone’s permission to use them like you need people to follow for labor leverage or give you money for capital leverage. You can code, write books, record videos, podcasts, tweet and so on. The possibilities are endless.  The new generation’s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making 50 to a 100 million bucks a year from his podcast. You’re going to have a PewDiePie. I don’t know how much money he’s rolling in, but he’s bigger than the news. The Fortnite players. Of course Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That is all code-based leverage.Now the beauty is when you combine these 3: take the minimum but highest output labor, add in capital, add in lots of code and media to get it out there. This is why tech startups excel, use massive leverage and make huge return.There are already way more robots than there are humans  The robot army is already here. The robot revolution has already happened. We’re about halfway through it. We’re just adding in much more of the hardware component these days as we get more comfortable with the idea of autonomous vehicles and autonomous airplanes and autonomous ships and maybe autonomous trucks. There’re delivery bots and Boston Dynamics robots and all that.Coding is a great superpower because you can speak their language and tell them what to do.Product leverage is a positive-sum gameIt’s the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible by everybody. It tends to be at the center, at the sweet spot, the middle class, rather than being targeted at the upper class. With other products, let’s say a Lamborghini, that’s not true.An ideal business model has network effects, low marginal costs and scale economiesScale economies: the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. Making a product #100 is cheaper than making product #99. This builds up an automatic barrier to entry against competition and getting commoditized.Zero marginal cost of reproduction: producing more is free. When somebody listens to a podcast, it doesn’t cost the producer anything for the next person to show up. It takes a while to get going because you make very little money per user but it adds up overtime.Network effects: value grows as the square of the customers. Each new user adds value to the existing users. If a network of size 10 has a value of a 100, one of size 100 would have a value of 10,000. It’s not 10 squared but 100 squared. For example, Facebook won the network effects where all your friends and family are there. English is the most common language because the largest community of people on the Internet speaks English.Example: from laborer to entrepreneurLet’s look at real estate business. You start at the bottom as a day laborer. You fix people’s houses and get paid by the hour. Your skills can be trained so you’re replaceable. You don’t have any leverage from the tool you’re using. You don’t have much accountability.Step up, you’re a contractor. You’re now taking responsibility and risk because if a project fails, you eat the losses. You have labor leverage because you have a bunch of people working for you. You get paid $100K for the job where $70K goes into the actual costs and $30K goes into your pocket.Step up, you’re a property developer. You look for beaten down properties that have potential, buy with your own money or raise it, fix the places, sell them 2x the original price. You take on more accountability and risk. You have more specific knowledge because you know which neighborhoods are worth buying in. You also have capital leverage because you put money there.Step up, you’re an famous architect or developer where by just having your name on a property increases its value.Step up, you’re a massive developer. You’re going to build entire communities. You don’t want to manage people but do it more through capital. You’re starting a real estate investment trust. At this stage, you must have specific knowledge about not just about investing in real estate and building real estate but the financial markets, and the capital markets, and how real estate trusts operate.Step up, you build a real estate tech company. You now have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate. It’s high risk, high accountability, with maximum leverage from code and media. You might end up with a Zillow kind of company and billions of dollars in value.  As you layer in more and more kinds of knowledge that can only be gained on the job and aren’t common knowledge, and you layer in more and more accountability and risk-taking, and you layer in more and more great people working on it and more and more capital on it, and more and more code and media on it, you keep expanding the scope of the opportunity all the way from the day-laborer, who might just literally be scrappling on the ground with their hands, all the way up to somebody who started a real estate tech company and then took it public.Judgment is the most important skill  Warren Buffett is so wealthy now because of his judgment. Even if you were to take away all of Warren’s money, tomorrow, investors would come out of the woodwork and hand him a $100 billion because they know his judgment is so good, and they would give him a big chunk of that $100 billion to invest.Judgment is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. It’s very hard to build up where you need to combine both intellect and experience. Intellect without any experience is useless because you have no skin in the game, no real experience, no real accountability, you’re just throwing darts. That said, you need to iterate fast and smart, take 10,000 tries at something.Another hard part to judgement is not the learning itself but the unlearning. Adding to what you know is easy but unlearning your opinons is hard. It’s the beginner mind that every great person has. You have to be willing to hit reset and start from scratch.Judgment comes from clear thinking. Clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity. Some of the greatest investors think most of the time. They read and study everything, including a lot of philosophy. That make them more stoic, less emotional so they can make better decisions and have better judgment.Set an aspirational hourly rate and stick to it  You can spend your life however you want. But if you want to get rich, it has to be your top priority. It has to come before anything else, which means you can’t penny-pinch. This is what people don’t understand. You can penny-pinch your way to basic sustenance. You can keep expenses low and maybe retire early. That’s perfectly valid. But we’re here to talk about wealth creation. If you’re going to create wealth, it has to be your number-one, overwhelming priority.No one is going to value you more than you value you. Your rate should seem and feel absurdly high. Start treating yourself that way. Factor your time into every decision. Let’s say you value your time at $5,000 an hour. If you spend an hour driving across town to get something, you’re effectively throwing away $5,000. Are you going to do that?Work as hard as you canIf getting wealthy is your goal, you’re going to have to work as hard as you can. However, before doing that, make sure you pick the right area to work in and the right people to work with because these 2 matters more than how hard you work.  When you’re building a business, or a career, first figure out: “What should I be doing? Where is a market emerging? What’s a product I can build that I’m excited to work on, where I have specific knowledge?”No one works 80 hours a week with mental clarity. The way they tend to work most effectively is to work as hard as they can while they feel inspired to work and take long breaks. When they have inspiration, they act on it immediately, as quickly as they can and with their full attention. Also, be patience with results because they’re dealing with complex systems and a lot of people.  “We get these questions a lot from the enterprising young. It’s a very intelligent question: You look at some old guy who’s rich and you ask, ‘How can I become like you, except faster?’ Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts… Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day, at the end of the day - if you live long enough - most people get what they deserve.” - Charlie MungerRuthlessly decline meetings. Only meet when it’s absolutely necessary, with strict agenda, when you have something important and valuable to discuss. When you think that you’re not networking enough to “make it”, you’re wrong. When you have hope for that lucky break, you’re replying on the first 2 kinds of luck mentioned above. You want to focus on the 3th and 4th kinds because they’re better. You spend time developing a reputation, unique point of view so they are able to spot opportunities that others can’t.Keep redefining what you do until you’re the best at what you doYou want to be number one at whatever you do. You can get paid for just being you. No one can compete with you on being you.The best founders listen to everyone but make up their own mindWhat make a person successful might not apply to you. You can’t take their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. You listen to advices but you also examine them, make up your own mind and your own point of view.When you’re wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first placeMoney will solve all your money problems, but it doesn’t get you everywhere. Even if you have all the money in the world, you can’t have a fit body, a calm mind, and good relationships if you don’t work on them. You’ll realize that they can bring a lot of peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.After all, your life is short. You should enjoy yourself.References:  https://nav.al/rich  https://tim.blog/2020/10/15/naval-transcript/",

place</a></li></ul><hr /><h2 id=\"seek-wealth-not-money\">Seek wealth, not money</h2><p>Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep: robots cranking out things, computer program serving customers, money that is reinvested into other assets and businesses. The purpose of wealth is freedom. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want anymore. You can get up or sleep whenever you want, live anywhere you want, pursue anything you want.</p><p>Money is how we transfer wealth, not wealth itself. It’s social credits, meaning that if you create value for society, you get paid by credits, which is money in the case. In other word, money is a medium of exchange.</p><h2 id=\"make-abundance-for-the-world\">Make abundance for the world</h2><p>Wealth isn’t about taking money or something from somebody else but creating abundance. Make something lots of people want.</p><blockquote>  <p>Everybody can be wealthy. Everybody can be retired. Everybody can be successful. It is merely a question of education and desire. You have to want it. If you don’t want it, that’s fine. Then you opt out of the game.</p></blockquote><p>For example, the thing that makes Bitcoin interesting is not that it’s the best technology but it has the most diehard fan out there. As long as there are believers, like a movement or a religion, it’s a currency. If the world decide that Bitcoin is better than US dollars, it would switch to Bitcoin. It’s a consensus belief.</p><h2 id=\"making-money-isnt-about-luck\">Making money isn’t about luck</h2><p>There are 4 kinds of luck:</p><ul>  <li>Blind luck: you get lucky because something completely out of your control happens.</li>  <li>Luck from hustling: luck that comes through persistence, hard work, hustle.</li>  <li>Luck from preparation: if you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in that field.</li>  <li>Luck from your unique character: you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.</li></ul><p>The first 3 kinds are clear. The 4th one, it’s about becoming the kind of person that makes money. You create your own luck, build your character so opportunity finds you.</p><blockquote>  <p>If you’re a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term thinking deal maker, then when other people want to do deals but they don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the integrity and reputation that you have built up. Warren Buffett, he gets offered deals, and he gets to buy companies, and he gets to buy warrants, and bailout banks and do things that other people can’t do because of his reputation.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"you-wont-get-rich-renting-out-your-time\">You won’t get rich renting out your time</h2><p>In most salaried job, even at one that’s paying a lot per hour like a doctor, you’re still getting paid by the hours. When you’re sleeping, retired, or on vacation, you’re not earning. That means:</p><ul>  <li>Your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs.</li>  <li>You not creating that much original for society.</li>  <li>You’re essentially replaceable by robots or AI because you’re doing a set role.</li></ul><p>You want a job, or a career, or a profession where your inputs don’t match your outputs, where you can put 1 hour of work that can produce 100x output. For example, a great engineer can create bitcoin and that is billions of dollars worth of value. Another way of saying is to look for things that are leveraged. Using the same example, a computer is a tool that software engineers use to get leverage. A lumberjack that uses robots for help can be more efficient than someone using their bare hands.</p><blockquote>  <p>So everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you can be working at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start. But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. They’re in an investment firm, and they’re buying equity. These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"live-below-your-means\">Live below your means</h2><p>When you become a bit more wealthy, you don’t want to upgrade your lifestyle too fast. Ideally you want to make your money in discrete lumps, separated over long periods of time so that your lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly.</p><h2 id=\"give-society-what-it-wants-but-doesnt-know-how-to-get-at-scale\">Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get at scale</h2><p>Almost everything that you own used to be technology at one point in time and made someone rich. Oil was a technology that made Rockefeller rich. Cars were technology that made Ford rich. Once technology works, or becomes mainstream, it’s no longer technology. That said, you want to figure out what thing or technology per say, you can provide for society that it doesn’t know how to get yet. Then you have to figure out how to scale it to millions, billions of them so that everyone can have one. In other words, you’re bringing the high end to the mass market. First you create it because you want it and know how to build it. Once you’ve built it for yourself, figure out how to get it to other in a profitable way.</p><h2 id=\"the-internet-allows-you-to-scale-any-niche-obsession\">The internet allows you to scale any niche obsession</h2><p>You can find your audience on the internet, on any niche, build a business, create a product, and build wealth as long as you’re the best at it to scale out. The more authentic you are, the less competition you’re gonna have. No one can compete with you on being you.</p><blockquote>  <p>The space of careers has been so broadened. E-sports players, you know, people making millions of dollars playing Fortnite. People creating videos, and uploading them. YouTube broadcasters. Bloggers, podcasters. Joe Rogan, I read, true or false, I don’t know, but I read that he’s gonna make about $100 million a year on his podcast. And he’s had 2 billion downloads.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"all-returns-in-life-come-from-compound-interest-in-long-term-games\">All returns in life come from compound interest in long-term games</h2><p>What industries should you work in? What kind of job should you should have? Who do you might want to work with? Pick one where you can play long-term games with long-term people because they’re good with compound interest and with trust. In a long-term game, everyone is making each other rich while in a short-term one, they are making themselves rich.</p><p>Not just wealth but all returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. A good hack is to find the thing that feel like playing to you (but work to other) that you can do long term. For example, you can find a healthy food that you enjoy and eat them regularly. You can find an good exercise routine that you can do every day or every other day so that it becomes a part of your life. Hacking on some code that you enjoy is more productive than playing video games. That said, finding the things that make the long term feel effortless to you is the key to winning.</p><h2 id=\"pick-business-partners-with-high-intelligence-energy-and-integrity\">Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity</h2><p>You can’t compromise on any of these 3:</p><ul>  <li>They need to be smart (at different things), or they’ll go in the wrong direction.</li>  <li>They need to be high-energy/motivated because the world is full of smart, lazy people. That motivation, however, has to come intrinsically.</li>  <li>They need to be high-integrity or they’ll cheat you.</li></ul><h2 id=\"be-a-rational-optimist\">Be a rational optimist</h2><p>Being rational is when you know all the pitfalls, upsides, downsides. Being optimistic is when you look up to every possibility, know your capabilities get things done and you have a strong action bias. Before deciding if an idea is viable or not, do it first, test it out.</p><h2 id=\"arm-yourself-with-specific-knowledge\">Arm yourself with specific knowledge</h2><p>Specific knowledge can’t be trained. If you can be trained for it, then someone else can be trained for it too. If you’re replaceable, you get paid by minimum wage because there are lots of other who can do the same thing as you.</p><p>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your innate talents, genuine curiosity, and passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job or going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.</p><blockquote>  <p>My whole value system was built around scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things, talking to people. So, I have some sales skills, which is a form specific knowledge that I have. I have some analytical skills around how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. I also just love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.</p></blockquote><p>Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships. The classic example is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free.</p><p>Specific knowledge is often highly creative or technical. Scott Adams is a good example of this where he is really good at making predictions through persuasive arguments and videos.</p><blockquote>  <p>And that is specific knowledge that he has built up over the years because he got obsessed with hypnosis when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he embraced Periscope early, so he’s been practicing lots of conversation, he’s read all the books on the topic, he’s employed it in his everyday life.</p></blockquote><p>A pragmatic approach to build up specific knowledge is to become top 5 at three or more things. It’s important that you also pick things where you are a natural, that you enjoy and makes you unique.</p><h2 id=\"learn-to-sell-learn-to-build\">Learn to sell, learn to build</h2><p>Building the product can include design, development, manufacturing, operating and so on. Selling it can include marketing, communicating, raising money and so on. Generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best where you have two founders, one is world class at selling, and the other is world class at building. It’s the magic combination.</p><p>Start out with a building mentality and learn selling later because it’s harder otherwise. Sales skills could mean in different than traditional domain. For example, you are an engineer. You might not good at hand-to-hand sales but you’re a good communicator that can leverage it for your sales. You might not good at writing but you’re good at recruiting or fundraising.</p><h2 id=\"read-what-you-love-until-you-love-to-read\">Read what you love until you love to read</h2><p>The foundation of learning is reading. No smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.</p><p>To read more, develop a love for reading. To do that, read books that you love. Just read the things that interest you until reading becomes a habit.</p><p>It is important to read foundational books, the original one in a given field that are very scientific in their nature. Build up a solid foundation so that you don’t fear anything. You can just take any book in the library, read and understand it.</p><blockquote>  <p>For example, instead of reading a business book, pick up Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Instead of reading a book on biology or evolution that’s written today, I would pick up Darwin’s Origin of the Species. Instead of reading a book on biotech right now that may be very advanced, I would just pick up The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. Instead of reading advanced books on what cosmology and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you can pick up Richard Feynman’s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.</p></blockquote><p>Also learn computer programming.</p><blockquote>  <p>I would say that the five most important skills are of course, reading, writing, arithmetic, and then as you’re adding in, persuasion, which is talking. And then finally, I would add computer programming just because it’s an applied form of arithmetic that just gets you so much leverage for free in any domain that you operate in. If you’re good with computers, if you’re good at basic mathematics, if you’re good at writing, if you’re good at speaking, and if you like reading, you’re set for life.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"theres-no-actual-skill-called-business\">There’s no actual skill called ‘business’</h2><blockquote>  <p>A lot of what goes on in business schools, and there is some very intelligent stuff taught in business schools – I don’t mean to detract from them completely – some of the things taught in business school are just anecdotes. They call them “case studies.” But they’re just anecdotes, and they’re trying to help you pattern match by throwing lots of data points at you, but the reality is, you will never understand them fully until you’re actually in that position yourself.</p></blockquote><p>You can’t learn about running a business by watching others do it or studying/reading about others doing it. You can only learn by operating your own business, even opening your own lemonade stand or a retail store. However, you have to be careful about how you do it. If you start a business where you’re doing the same thing everyday, you’re not learning that much. Instead of putting in thousands of hours doing the same thing, you want to put in <em>thousands of iterations</em> to experiment, validate, test your idea. Of course doing something new is painful and you could lose money, be stressed out but you have to get very comfortable with frequent small failures. When you win, you’ll win big. On average, you’ll make more.</p><blockquote>  <p>Nassim Taleb talks about this also. He made his fortune, his wealth by being a trader who basically relied upon black swans. Nassim Taleb made money by losing little bits of money every day and then once in a blue moon he would make a lot of money when the unthinkable happened for other people.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"you-need-accountability-to-get-leverage\">You need accountability to get leverage</h2><p>To get rich, you need to get leverage, which can come from labor (somebody works for you), capital (somebody gives you money), or code or media. To get these things, you need to build up credibility by building these under your own name. Having accountability allows you to take credit when things go well but also take risk of failure, humiliation. You’re taking greater downside risk for greater upside. That is not bad in reality because even if you fail in public, you actually gain a lot of power. Look at people like Kanye, Oprah, Elon. They sometime fail big but they’re are still very wealthy and powerful because their name are such powerful brandings.</p><p>Plus, you’re less replaceable if you have high accountability.</p><h2 id=\"labor-and-capital-are-old-leverage\">Labor and capital are old leverage</h2><p>Labor is the oldest form, which is people working for you, though it’s the worst one for two reasons. One, managing people requires tremendous leadership skills. Two, it’s incredibly competed over as people fight really hard to win. That said, you want to stay out of this or use it as little as possible.</p><p>Capital is more modern, which is people moving large amounts of money around. It’s the dominant one that people have used to get extremely wealthy in the last century. It’s powerful. It can be converted to labor as well as other things. It scales well. The hard thing is obtain it. If you have specific knowledge and high accountability in a domain, people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage so you can go get more capital.</p><h2 id=\"product-and-media-are-new-leverage\">Product and media are new leverage</h2><p>The most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. You can multiply your efforts without having to involve labor or capital. It was invented in the last 100 years, starting with printing press, accelerating with broadcast media, and now blowing up with Internet and coding.</p><p>Product and media leverage are permissionless in a sense that you don’t need anyone’s permission to use them like you need people to follow for labor leverage or give you money for capital leverage. You can code, write books, record videos, podcasts, tweet and so on. The possibilities are endless.</p><blockquote>  <p>The new generation’s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making 50 to a 100 million bucks a year from his podcast. You’re going to have a PewDiePie. I don’t know how much money he’s rolling in, but he’s bigger than the news. The Fortnite players. Of course Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. That is all code-based leverage.</p></blockquote><p>Now the beauty is when you combine these 3: take the minimum but highest output labor, add in capital, add in lots of code and media to get it out there. This is why tech startups excel, use massive leverage and make huge return.</p><h2 id=\"there-are-already-way-more-robots-than-there-are-humans\">There are already way more robots than there are humans</h2><blockquote>  <p>The robot army is already here. The robot revolution has already happened. We’re about halfway through it. We’re just adding in much more of the hardware component these days as we get more comfortable with the idea of autonomous vehicles and autonomous airplanes and autonomous ships and maybe autonomous trucks. There’re delivery bots and Boston Dynamics robots and all that.</p></blockquote><p>Coding is a great superpower because you can speak their language and tell them what to do.</p><h2 id=\"product-leverage-is-a-positive-sum-game\">Product leverage is a positive-sum game</h2><p>It’s the nature of code and media output that the same product is accessible by everybody. It tends to be at the center, at the sweet spot, the middle class, rather than being targeted at the upper class. With other products, let’s say a Lamborghini, that’s not true.</p><h2 id=\"an-ideal-business-model-has-network-effects-low-marginal-costs-and-scale-economies\">An ideal business model has network effects, low marginal costs and scale economies</h2><p>Scale economies: the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. Making a product #100 is cheaper than making product #99. This builds up an automatic barrier to entry against competition and getting commoditized.</p><p>Zero marginal cost of reproduction: producing more is free. When somebody listens to a podcast, it doesn’t cost the producer anything for the next person to show up. It takes a while to get going because you make very little money per user but it adds up overtime.</p><p>Network effects: value grows as the square of the customers. Each new user adds value to the existing users. If a network of size 10 has a value of a 100, one of size 100 would have a value of 10,000. It’s not 10 squared but 100 squared. For example, Facebook won the network effects where all your friends and family are there. English is the most common language because the largest community of people on the Internet speaks English.</p><h2 id=\"example-from-laborer-to-entrepreneur\">Example: from laborer to entrepreneur</h2><p>Let’s look at real estate business. You start at the bottom as a day laborer. You fix people’s houses and get paid by the hour. Your skills can be trained so you’re replaceable. You don’t have any leverage from the tool you’re using. You don’t have much accountability.</p><p>Step up, you’re a contractor. You’re now taking responsibility and risk because if a project fails, you eat the losses. You have labor leverage because you have a bunch of people working for you. You get paid $100K for the job where $70K goes into the actual costs and $30K goes into your pocket.</p><p>Step up, you’re a property developer. You look for beaten down properties that have potential, buy with your own money or raise it, fix the places, sell them 2x the original price. You take on more accountability and risk. You have more specific knowledge because you know which neighborhoods are worth buying in. You also have capital leverage because you put money there.</p><p>Step up, you’re an famous architect or developer where by just having your name on a property increases its value.</p><p>Step up, you’re a massive developer. You’re going to build entire communities. You don’t want to manage people but do it more through capital. You’re starting a real estate investment trust. At this stage, you must have specific knowledge about not just about investing in real estate and building real estate but the financial markets, and the capital markets, and how real estate trusts operate.</p><p>Step up, you build a real estate tech company. You now have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate. It’s high risk, high accountability, with maximum leverage from code and media. You might end up with a Zillow kind of company and billions of dollars in value.</p><blockquote>  <p>As you layer in more and more kinds of knowledge that can only be gained on the job and aren’t common knowledge, and you layer in more and more accountability and risk-taking, and you layer in more and more great people working on it and more and more capital on it, and more and more code and media on it, you keep expanding the scope of the opportunity all the way from the day-laborer, who might just literally be scrappling on the ground with their hands, all the way up to somebody who started a real estate tech company and then took it public.</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"judgment-is-the-most-important-skill\">Judgment is the most important skill</h2><blockquote>  <p>Warren Buffett is so wealthy now because of his judgment. Even if you were to take away all of Warren’s money, tomorrow, investors would come out of the woodwork and hand him a $100 billion because they know his judgment is so good, and they would give him a big chunk of that $100 billion to invest.</p></blockquote><p>Judgment is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. It’s very hard to build up where you need to combine both intellect and experience. Intellect without any experience is useless because you have no skin in the game, no real experience, no real accountability, you’re just throwing darts. That said, you need to iterate fast and smart, take 10,000 tries at something.</p><p>Another hard part to judgement is not the learning itself but the unlearning. Adding to what you know is easy but unlearning your opinons is hard. It’s the beginner mind that every great person has. You have to be willing to hit reset and start from scratch.</p><p>Judgment comes from clear thinking. Clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity. Some of the greatest investors think most of the time. They read and study everything, including a lot of philosophy. That make them more stoic, less emotional so they can make better decisions and have better judgment.</p><h2 id=\"set-an-aspirational-hourly-rate-and-stick-to-it\">Set an aspirational hourly rate and stick to it</h2><blockquote>  <p>You can spend your life however you want. But if you want to get rich, it has to be your top priority. It has to come before anything else, which means you can’t penny-pinch. This is what people don’t understand. You can penny-pinch your way to basic sustenance. You can keep expenses low and maybe retire early. That’s perfectly valid. But we’re here to talk about wealth creation. If you’re going to create wealth, it has to be your number-one, overwhelming priority.</p></blockquote><p>No one is going to value you more than you value you. Your rate should seem and feel absurdly high. Start treating yourself that way. Factor your time into every decision. Let’s say you value your time at $5,000 an hour. If you spend an hour driving across town to get something, you’re effectively throwing away $5,000. Are you going to do that?</p><h2 id=\"work-as-hard-as-you-can\">Work as hard as you can</h2><p>If getting wealthy is your goal, you’re going to have to work as hard as you can. However, before doing that, make sure you pick the right area to work in and the right people to work with because these 2 matters more than how hard you work.</p><blockquote>  <p>When you’re building a business, or a career, first figure out: “What should I be doing? Where is a market emerging? What’s a product I can build that I’m excited to work on, where I have specific knowledge?”</p></blockquote><p>No one works 80 hours a week with mental clarity. The way they tend to work most effectively is to work as hard as they can while they feel inspired to work and take long breaks. When they have inspiration, they act on it immediately, as quickly as they can and with their full attention. Also, be patience with results because they’re dealing with complex systems and a lot of people.</p><blockquote>  <p>“We get these questions a lot from the enterprising young. It’s a very intelligent question: You look at some old guy who’s rich and you ask, ‘How can I become like you, except faster?’ Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts… Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day, at the end of the day - if you live long enough - most people get what they deserve.” - Charlie Munger</p></blockquote><p>Ruthlessly decline meetings. Only meet when it’s absolutely necessary, with strict agenda, when you have something important and valuable to discuss. When you think that you’re not networking enough to “make it”, you’re wrong. When you have hope for that lucky break, you’re replying on the first 2 kinds of luck mentioned above. You want to focus on the 3th and 4th kinds because they’re better. You spend time developing a reputation, unique point of view so they are able to spot opportunities that others can’t.</p><h2 id=\"keep-redefining-what-you-do-until-youre-the-best-at-what-you-do\">Keep redefining what you do until you’re the best at what you do</h2><p>You want to be number one at whatever you do. You can get paid for just being you. No one can compete with you on being you.</p><h2 id=\"the-best-founders-listen-to-everyone-but-make-up-their-own-mind\">The best founders listen to everyone but make up their own mind</h2><p>What make a person successful might not apply to you. You can’t take their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. You listen to advices but you also examine them, make up your own mind and your own point of view.</p><h2 id=\"when-youre-wealthy-youll-realize-it-wasnt-what-you-were-seeking-in-the-first-place\">When you’re wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place</h2><p>Money will solve all your money problems, but it doesn’t get you everywhere. Even if you have all the money in the world, you can’t have a fit body, a calm mind, and good relationships if you don’t work on them. You’ll realize that they can bring a lot of peace and happiness than any amount of money ever will.</p><p>After all, your life is short. You should enjoy yourself.</p><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://nav.al/rich\">https://nav.al/rich</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://tim.blog/2020/10/15/naval-transcript/\">https://tim.blog/2020/10/15/naval-transcript/</a></li></ul>",

In a startup, instead of working at a low intensity for 40 years, you compress all this stress, work as hard as you possibly can for 4 years. At the end of the day, to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars’ worth of pain.Money is not wealth  Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.Money is a way of moving wealth. It is a side effect of specialization, where most of the things you need, you can’t make it yourself but to get it from someone else using money as a medium of exchange. Now, people think that what a business does is make money but what it really does is to make wealth. They do something people want.The people most likely to make wealth are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmenA programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth by making good software. There are also variations in the rate at which wealth is created. A great programmer could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks while a mediocre one over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth introducing bugs.You don’t need to join a company to make something people want  In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people’s. You may not even be aware you’re doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won’t make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.A company is a group of people working together to do something people want. Doing something people want is what matters, not joining the group.Measurement and leverage are 2 keys things to get richSince ordinary employee’s performance can’t usually be measured effectively, it’s hard to start working 10x harder and get paid 10x as much. Salesmen are an exception because it’s easy to measure how much revenue they generate. Same with top management jobs as they are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. That said, to get rich, you need to be in a position where your performance can be measured and you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect. For example, a lead actor in a movie’s performance can be measured in the gross of the movie and they can have leverage as their performance can make/break it. Similar to CEO of a company as their performance is the company’s performance and they have the ultimate leverage over the company.A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure as if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. If there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.Smallness = MeasurementYou don’t have to become a CEO or movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem, and that is a startup.When the startup is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. The result of working 10x harder is noticeable, measurable and can get paid with 10x as much. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another, the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.Technology = LeverageStartups offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology/technique. When you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution, its value is multiplied. That’s leverage.There is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. Technology moves fast as it could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies don’t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches while small companies are less constrained by convention. In contrast, big companies can develop technology but can’t do it fast nor reward appropriately for their employee’s effort. However, it’s possible that big companies can take your market away overnight. In order to prevent that from happening, you must always seek hard problems.  Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that’s simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don’t need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.There’s still more hard things to come. One of which is that you can’t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. When you’re running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. The other is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. Let’s say you’re 10x as productive. In reality, it is not that get paid 10x as much, but between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 10x, the median is probably zero.It’s a good idea to get bought, if you can  Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It’s also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client’s assets into one volatile stock?Getting bought is also an art in its own right. The hard part is getting potential buyers to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss, that is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. The second worry is that, if they don’t buy you now, you’ll grow rapidly and cost more to acquire latter, or even become a competitor.In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. They don’t care about how valuable your technology is but the number of users you have. Users are the only real proof that you’ve created wealth. If no one uses your software, you haven’t made what they want. Again, you’re not just solving problems. You’re solving problems that that users care about.References:  http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html",

Why? Because they try hard to think of startup ideas and fool themselves into working on them while paying no attention to the market or users. Now, in order to ensure that a problem exists, look within yourself, find problems that you have yourself and work on that. This way, you know that you, as an user, will use it and hopefully others will too.  For example, a social network for pet owners sounds reasonable. Millions of people have pets and invest a tons in them so maybe they would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don’t say “I would never use this.” They say “Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.” Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don’t want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.When a startup launches, there must be some users who really want what you’re making, not those who could see themselves using it one day. Initially, this group of people is small but that’s okay. You want to build something a small number of people want a large amount, not the other way around. Microsoft made Altair Basic when there were only a couple of thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Facebook used to be exclusively for Harvard students but those wanted it a lot.Live in the future, then build what’s missing or what seems interestingThe way to have good organic startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them. It means to live in the future, being at the leading edge of a rapid changing field, look for things that seem to be missing, pay particular attention to things that chafe/annoy you and ask a lot of questions, take note of gaps and anomalies, and be prepare to grasp the opportunities as they present.  The way successful founders have had their ideas, it’s generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind. Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think “I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.” Drew Houston realizes he’s forgotten his USB stick and thinks “I really need to make my files live online.”Work on projects that seem like they’d be cool if exist. But don’t feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That’s premature optimization. Until you have some users to measure, you’re optimizing based on guesses. Just build things. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them. Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another.While the real recipe is to live in the future and build what seems interesting, here are some tricks to come up with not-so organic ideas:  Look in areas where you have some expertise.  Ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it.  Discover the needs while working on different ideas.  Unmet need of someone else. Talking to people about the gaps they find in the world. What’s missing? What would they like to do that they can’t? What’s tedious or annoying, particularly in their work? Understand them deeply and make them your own.Don’t fear competitionCompetition is one of the signs of a good idea. A crowded market is another. Either case, it means that there’s demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough.When you have one good idea, you’ll tend to feel that you’re late. Don’t. It’s rarely for startups to be killed by competitors. If you’re uncertain, just ask users.Turn off the schlep filterMost people prefer not to deal with tedious, unpleasant problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world. Let’s take Stripe for example. For years, thousands of people who had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was and yet when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or aggregators for local events.  Though the idea of fixing payments was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved. You’d have to make deals with banks. How do you do that? Plus you’re moving money, so you’re going to have to deal with fraud, and people trying to break into your servers. Plus there are probably all sorts of regulations to comply with. It’s a lot more intimidating to start a startup like this than a recipe site.It’s an extremely hard problem and that scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable. That said, turn off the schlep filter.References:  http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html",

How to get there          In the early days of a product, don’t focus on making it robust. Instead, find product/market fit first, then harden.      Before you get product/market fit, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.      Founders have to choose a market long before they have any idea whether they will reach product/market fit.      Why market matters more than anything3 important factors that are required for building a successful business are people, markets, and products. While different people weight each of these differently at different times, Don Valentine believes that the marketplace always comes first because you can’t change that, but you can change the people if needed to later on. Also, Rachleff observes that the most successful startups didn’t have the world’s best management teams in the very early days, but happened to have conceived an idea that addresses an amazing point of pain around which consumers where desperate for a solution.What is product/market fit?Identifying a compelling reasons/assumptions that underlies why a customer is likely to use your product is finding product/market fit. This helps you identify the features you need to build, the audience that’s likely to care, and the business model required to entice a customer to buy your product.  “If you address a market that really wants your product, if the dogs are eating the dog food, then you can screw up almost everything in the company and you will succeed. Conversely, if you’re really good at execution but the dogs don’t want to eat the dog food, you have no chance of winning.” - Andy RachleffThe process behind product/market fitEven though serendipity plays a role in finding product/market fit, there is a consistent process. You want to apply the scientific method just like scientists do: start with a hypothesis, test it, prove it, move on or further iterate on the hypothesis.  What are you going to build?  Who is desperate for it?  What is the business model you are going to use to deliver it?Start with the product then try to find the market, no the other way around. The iteration is more about the market and the business model than the product itself.How to tell if you do have product/market fitBeing in a good market matters more than having a product that can satisfy the market.According to Andreessen, assuming that you have the best product in the world and a killer team, you’re going to fail if you are in a terrible market. However, if you’re in a good market, you can have a buggy product and a OK team, success can happen quickly. Of course it won’t last until the product is fixed but at least it has a wonderful start.You have fit if your product grows exponentially with no marketing.  “You can always feel when product/market fit isn’t happening. The customers aren’t quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast, press reviews are kind of ‘blah’, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close. And you can always feel product/market fit when it’s happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You’re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters are calling because they’ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You could eat free for a year at Buck’s.” - Marc AndreessenThe number one problem for startups is when they don’t actually have product/market fit but they think they do.Again, a good way to know when you reach product/market fit is to verify if your product is growing without any advertising spending.Correct common misconceptionsFirst to market seldom matters. Rather, first to product/market fit is almost always the long-term winner.Intuit, Apple, Google, and Facebook are examples of how being the first mover isn’t necessarily the advantage. After all, the winner is the first company to deliver the food the dogs want to eat.Once you achieve product/market fit, it’s possible that you can lose it.Markets and competitors are always changing. Constant adaptation is therefore required to retain product/market fit. A good way to do so as Steve Blank observes is to have tight fact-based data/metrics feedback loop to help you make/reverse decisions.One of the most common ways that startups die is premature scaling.Steve Bank believes that a business is “scaling prematurely” if it is spending significant amounts of money on growth before it has discovered and developed product/market fit. This happens more often than we think, about 70% of startups according to Startup Genome. That said, startups needs 2-3 times longer to validate their market before focusing on growth than most founders expect.How to get thereIn the early days of a product, don’t focus on making it robust. Instead, find product/market fit first, then harden.There is no value in hardening something that customers don’t want to buy. At first, the product doesn’t need to be great; it just needs to work.Before you get product/market fit, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.  “Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required. When you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else. I’m not suggesting that you do ignore everything else — just that judging from what I’ve seen in successful startups, you can.” - AndreessenFounders have to choose a market long before they have any idea whether they will reach product/market fit.Some venture capitalists would rather buy a business with product-market fit than try to predict whether a founder will find it. They want to have founders do the heavy lifting and think carefully before they get involved in the first place.References:  https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/",

            "content_text": " Table of Contents   Definition  High resistance  Mental focus  Power breathing  5F  Exercises, from zero to hero          Pistol squat      One-arm pushup      DefinitionStrength is built by tensing the muscles harder, not by exhausting them with reps. Now, in order to achieve high tension, you need:  High resistance.  Mental focus on contracting the muscle harder.You want to treat your training as a practice rather than a workout.High resistanceWith heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by the powerlifts such as bench press, squat, deadlift, and so on. However, without heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by:  Redistributing your weight between your limbs: lifting your feet higher in a pushup focuses the weight more on your hands.  Manipulating the range of motion: doing one-leg squat on a bench instead of a full squat.  Training in an unstable environment: doing one-arm pushup or one-leg squat adds quite a lot of instability.  Varying the leverage: hanging straight leg lift is much harder than a tucked leg lift.  Minimizing bounce and momentum: doing dead-start one-arm pushup from the ground, or adding a long pause in between.Mental focusTo better demonstrate how important mental focus is on contracting the muscle, let’s look at different high-tension techniques for improving your strength instantly. The fact is, one of the most crucial skills in the performance of any strength athlete, whether it’s a gymnast, a powerlifter, or an arm wrestler, is the ability to contract a muscle to stay tight. Whenever a muscle contracts, it irradiates a nerve force around it and increases the intensity of the neighboring muscles’ contractions.  Make a fist. Note that as you grip harder, the tension in your forearm overflows into your upperarm, even your shoulder. Now, try to do push up with a tight grip. You’ll feel a lot stronger and be able to do more reps.  Feel your abs. Tensing your abs will amplify the intensity of the contraction of any muscle in your body. Martial art masters have been practiced this for years. This also explains why they are super strong even though they don’t look as big as powerlifters’. Now, contract your abs flat and strong but no need to pull in or push out. Two good ways to practice doing so is to do the back-pressure crunch where you try to press your lower back down hard against the floor in a normal crunch position and act like you’re about to get punched in the gut.  Strengthen your hips. Experienced fighters knows that real striking power is generated in the hips, rather than the knuckles. Now to strengthen your hips, contract your glutes by imagining pinching a coin with your cheeks.  Static stomp. Focus on applying maximum pressure to the deck with your foot when doing the pistol and with your palm when doing the one-arm pushup like you are stomping down. Feel the steady build-up of tension.  Tense your lats and keep your shoulders down while doing one-arm pushup, punch, and bench press. You want to push from the armpit, rather than the shoulder. This helps you put up heavier weight and suffer fewer shoulder injuries.  The corkscrew principle says that rotation, or spiral tension, increases the stability and power of almost any action. For a pushup, apply the inside-out corkscrew tension to the ground by twisting your arms while keeping your hands static.Power breathingBruce Lee used to say that martial arts rely more on breath strength than body strength. Indeed, power breathing is one of the most powerful way of increasing muscle strength where it maximizes the intra-abdominal pressure in order to amplify your strength.Inhale through your nose and send the pressure to your stomach, not your chest or head. Instead of focusing on where the air flows, focus on the compression. The quickest way to learn to pressurize is through the reverse power breathing technique:  Perform the anal lock by contracting your sphincter and keeping your pelvic diaphragm pulled up.  Pretend that you’re straining to have a bowel movement while maintaining the lock.  Send the pressure down low while keeping your abs flat, bracing it for a punch.  “Fail to master breath control and you can do nothing in karate except possibly a few cute tricks.” - Mas Oyama5F  Focus: Do not practice more than 2 exercises but really focus on masterting them, which are one-arm push up and pistol squat in this case.  Flawless: Practice using these 5 conditions: significant external resistance, application of the High Tension and Power Breathing techniques, limiting the repetitions to 5 per set or less, approaching each set relatively fresh (rest 5-10 mins between sets), and moving fairly slow.  Frequent: Since low reps are easier to recover from, the more frequent you practice, the stronger you become. It could be 6 times a week, in multiple mini sessions. Just make sure to avoid fatigue and overtraining.  Fresh: Do as much as you can while staying fresh (doing too little slows down your progress while doing too much makes you sore and weak) and do not push to failure. Remember, strength is a skill, treat it as a practice, not a workout.  Fluctuating: Put variety into the training. Constantly vary the sets, reps, and proximity to failure. Precede a strength test with one or two easy days and one day off. However, the less frequently you try for a PR, the better (every 2 weeks for beginner, every 2 months for experienced athlete).In short, you want to minimize the number of exercises and fatigue, maximize tension and frequency.Exercises, from zero to heroPistol squat  Bos pistol  Airborne lunge  Pistol classic  Negative-free pistol  Renegade pistol  Cossack pistol  Dynamic isometric pistol  Isometric pistol  Weighted pistolOne-arm pushup  Elevated one-arm pushup  Isometric one-arm pushup  One-arm dive bomber pushup  One-arm pump  One-arm/one-leg pushupReferences:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33295.The_Naked_Warrior",

Now, in order to achieve high tension, you need:</p><ol>  <li>High resistance.</li>  <li>Mental focus on contracting the muscle harder.</li></ol><p>You want to treat your training as a <em>practice</em> rather than a <em>workout</em>.</p><h2 id=\"high-resistance\">High resistance</h2><p>With heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by the powerlifts such as bench press, squat, deadlift, and so on. However, without heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by:</p><ul>  <li>Redistributing your weight between your limbs: lifting your feet higher in a pushup focuses the weight more on your hands.</li>  <li>Manipulating the range of motion: doing one-leg squat on a bench instead of a full squat.</li>  <li>Training in an unstable environment: doing one-arm pushup or one-leg squat adds quite a lot of instability.</li>  <li>Varying the leverage: hanging straight leg lift is much harder than a tucked leg lift.</li>  <li>Minimizing bounce and momentum: doing dead-start one-arm pushup from the ground, or adding a long pause in between.</li></ul><h2 id=\"mental-focus\">Mental focus</h2><p>To better demonstrate how important mental focus is on contracting the muscle, let’s look at different high-tension techniques for improving your strength instantly. The fact is, one of the most crucial skills in the performance of any strength athlete, whether it’s a gymnast, a powerlifter, or an arm wrestler, is the ability to contract a muscle to stay tight. Whenever a muscle contracts, it irradiates a nerve force around it and increases the intensity of the neighboring muscles’ contractions.</p><ol>  <li>Make a fist. Note that as you grip harder, the tension in your forearm overflows into your upperarm, even your shoulder. Now, try to do push up with a tight grip. You’ll feel a lot stronger and be able to do more reps.</li>  <li>Feel your abs. Tensing your abs will amplify the intensity of the contraction of any muscle in your body. Martial art masters have been practiced this for years. This also explains why they are super strong even though they don’t look as big as powerlifters’. Now, contract your abs flat and strong but no need to pull in or push out. Two good ways to practice doing so is to do the back-pressure crunch where you try to press your lower back down hard against the floor in a normal crunch position and act like you’re about to get punched in the gut.</li>  <li>Strengthen your hips. Experienced fighters knows that real striking power is generated in the hips, rather than the knuckles. Now to strengthen your hips, contract your glutes by imagining pinching a coin with your cheeks.</li>  <li>Static stomp. Focus on applying maximum pressure to the deck with your foot when doing the pistol and with your palm when doing the one-arm pushup like you are stomping down. Feel the steady build-up of tension.</li>  <li>Tense your lats and keep your shoulders down while doing one-arm pushup, punch, and bench press. You want to push from the armpit, rather than the shoulder. This helps you put up heavier weight and suffer fewer shoulder injuries.</li>  <li>The corkscrew principle says that rotation, or spiral tension, increases the stability and power of almost any action. For a pushup, apply the inside-out corkscrew tension to the ground by twisting your arms while keeping your hands static.</li></ol><h2 id=\"power-breathing\">Power breathing</h2><p>Bruce Lee used to say that martial arts rely more on breath strength than body strength. Indeed, power breathing is one of the most powerful way of increasing muscle strength where it maximizes the intra-abdominal pressure in order to amplify your strength.</p><p>Inhale through your nose and send the pressure to your stomach, not your chest or head. Instead of focusing on where the air flows, focus on the compression. The quickest way to learn to pressurize is through the reverse power breathing technique:</p><ol>  <li>Perform the anal lock by contracting your sphincter and keeping your pelvic diaphragm pulled up.</li>  <li>Pretend that you’re straining to have a bowel movement while maintaining the lock.</li>  <li>Send the pressure down low while keeping your abs flat, bracing it for a punch.</li></ol><blockquote>  <p>“Fail to master breath control and you can do nothing in karate except possibly a few cute tricks.” - Mas Oyama</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"5f\">5F</h2><ol>  <li>Focus: Do not practice more than 2 exercises but really focus on masterting them, which are one-arm push up and pistol squat in this case.</li>  <li>Flawless: Practice using these 5 conditions: significant external resistance, application of the High Tension and Power Breathing techniques, limiting the repetitions to 5 per set or less, approaching each set relatively fresh (rest 5-10 mins between sets), and moving fairly slow.</li>  <li>Frequent: Since low reps are easier to recover from, the more frequent you practice, the stronger you become. It could be 6 times a week, in multiple mini sessions. Just make sure to avoid fatigue and overtraining.</li>  <li>Fresh: Do as much as you can while staying fresh (doing too little slows down your progress while doing too much makes you sore and weak) and do not push to failure. Remember, strength is a skill, treat it as a practice, not a workout.</li>  <li>Fluctuating: Put variety into the training. Constantly vary the sets, reps, and proximity to failure. Precede a strength test with one or two easy days and one day off.

For examples, your height, age, shoe size, shopping habits,… don’tnecessarily cause you to buy this or that product. There might be a correlation between some ofcollected characteristics and the tendency of customers who purchase the same product. However, they don’tcause you to go and buy them.Introducing Job TheoryInstead of trying to find patterns and cross-references in the data sets of a product, it’s better tofigure out what its job function actually is. Essentially, when we buy a product, we hire it to geta job done in a specific circumstance or to make the progress we were struggling to achieve. For example,some people use Netflix because they want to be entertained, some use it to kill time, some use itfor educational purposes. Depending on the context and their unique circumstances, they hire Netflixto do different jobs which might not match what Netflix creators make it to do.That said, a job is defined as the progress that one is trying to make in a particular circumstance(where you at, when it is, what you are doing, who you are with, and so on). However, not only does a job hasfunctional dimensions (what it does), it also has social and emotional dimensions. For example, the jobfunction could be to hire childcare because of your busy schedule, the emotional dimensions then dependon who will you trust with your children.Job insights are more like stories and statisticsOne helpful way to grasp a job function is to go through this list of questions:  What progress is the person trying to achieve? What are the functional, social, emotional dimensions?  What are the circumstances? Who, when, where, while doing what?  What obstacles are getting in the way?  What have they tried so far? Are they using a workaround?  What would a better solution mean for them? At what trade-offs?Applying Job Theory5 ways to search for unresolved jobs  Look for jobs in your personal life: What are you struggling with?  Find opportunity in people who are not hiring any product. This mean they can’t find a solution that work for them so they give up.  Pay attention to people to create their own solutions, workarounds.  Look for what people don’t want to do because they feel frustrating about the process or something.  Spot unusual uses that are different from what your company has envisioned.Social and emotional dimensions are just important as functional dimensionsSometimes, faster, more features, more colors,… are not what customers want, but the ease of using might. Let’s takeP&amp;G’s example when they introduced diapers to China. They already knew how to sell to Western customersand assumed that if the diaper were affordable enough in developing country like China, it could be sold easily.However, it did not take off. After years of research, they realized that they focused too much on the functional aspectwithout taking into account the social and emotional dimensions of customer’s struggle. They found that babies whowore diapers fell asleep 30% faster and slept longer every night. Not only better sleep improved children’s cognitivedevelopment, because the babies had slept, parents could also have more time to rest and sleep as well. Using thisfinding explicitly in the ads and launch eventually made P&amp;G a top-selling brand in China.What customers hire is equally important as what they fireThe moment customers buy the product is equally important as the moment they actually consume it.There are 2 main forces that battle in their mind:  Habits of the present: “I’m used to doing it this way”, “I don’t love it but I’m comfortable with how I deal with it now”  Anxiety of choosing something new: “What if it’s not better?”Customers might not be able to tell you what they want but can tell you about their strugglesBefore launching, Airbnb storyboarded 45 different emotional moments for their hosts and guests in details.They tried to look for surprises, unexpected behavior, unusual product uses, product limitations, and so onbecause those were incredibly important to develop a more attractive product.  “One of the critical storyboard moments, for example, is the first Little Hire moment for guests-when they first turn up at the home in which they’ll stay. How are they greeted? If they’re expecting a place that has been described as relaxing, is that evident? Maybe there should be soft music playing or a scented candle, says Airbnb’s Chip Conley. Has the host made them feel at ease with their decision? Has the host made clear how they will solve any issues or problems that arise during the stay? And so on. The experience must match the customers’ vision of what they hired Airbnb to do. The Airbnb storyboards—which have been constantly tweaked and improved since its founding—reflect the importance of the combination of pushes and pulls that drive their customers’ Big Hires and Little Hires.”Once you figure out the job function, you want to create the desired experienceIf you can successfully nail the job, you can transform your company’s brand into a purpose branch such that customers automatically associate with your solutions:  IKEA: finish my apartment today  FedEx: send my documents fast  Apple: assure technology is easy to used and elegantly designed  Google: search anything immediatelyReferences:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820024-competing-against-luck",

For example, the jobfunction could be to hire childcare because of your busy schedule, the emotional dimensions then dependon who will you trust with your children.</p><h3 id=\"job-insights-are-more-like-stories-and-statistics\">Job insights are more like stories and statistics</h3><p>One helpful way to grasp a job function is to go through this list of questions:</p><ul>  <li>What progress is the person trying to achieve? What are the functional, social, emotional dimensions?</li>  <li>What are the circumstances? Who, when, where, while doing what?</li>  <li>What obstacles are getting in the way?</li>  <li>What have they tried so far? Are they using a workaround?</li>  <li>What would a better solution mean for them? At what trade-offs?</li></ul><h2 id=\"applying-job-theory\">Applying Job Theory</h2><h3 id=\"5-ways-to-search-for-unresolved-jobs\">5 ways to search for unresolved jobs</h3><ul>  <li>Look for jobs in your personal life: What are you struggling with?</li>  <li>Find opportunity in people who are not hiring any product. This mean they can’t find a solution that work for them so they give up.</li>  <li>Pay attention to people to create their own solutions, workarounds.</li>  <li>Look for what people don’t want to do because they feel frustrating about the process or something.</li>  <li>Spot unusual uses that are different from what your company has envisioned.</li></ul><h3 id=\"social-and-emotional-dimensions-are-just-important-as-functional-dimensions\">Social and emotional dimensions are just important as functional dimensions</h3><p>Sometimes, faster, more features, more colors,… are not what customers want, but the ease of using might. Let’s takeP&amp;G’s example when they introduced diapers to China. They already knew how to sell to Western customersand assumed that if the diaper were affordable enough in developing country like China, it could be sold easily.However, it did not take off. After years of research, they realized that they focused too much on the functional aspectwithout taking into account the social and emotional dimensions of customer’s struggle. They found that babies whowore diapers fell asleep 30% faster and slept longer every night. Not only better sleep improved children’s cognitivedevelopment, because the babies had slept, parents could also have more time to rest and sleep as well. Using thisfinding explicitly in the ads and launch eventually made P&amp;G a top-selling brand in China.</p><h3 id=\"what-customers-hire-is-equally-important-as-what-they-fire\">What customers hire is equally important as what they fire</h3><p>The moment customers buy the product is equally important as the moment they actually consume it.There are 2 main forces that battle in their mind:</p><ul>  <li>Habits of the present: “I’m used to doing it this way”, “I don’t love it but I’m comfortable with how I deal with it now”</li>  <li>Anxiety of choosing something new: “What if it’s not better?”</li></ul><h3 id=\"customers-might-not-be-able-to-tell-you-what-they-want-but-can-tell-you-about-their-struggles\">Customers might not be able to tell you what they want but can tell you about their struggles</h3><p>Before launching, Airbnb storyboarded 45 different emotional moments for their hosts and guests in details.They tried to look for surprises, unexpected behavior, unusual product uses, product limitations, and so onbecause those were incredibly important to develop a more attractive product.</p><blockquote>  <p>“One of the critical storyboard moments, for example, is the first Little Hire moment for guests-when they first turn up at the home in which they’ll stay. How are they greeted? If they’re expecting a place that has been described as relaxing, is that evident? Maybe there should be soft music playing or a scented candle, says Airbnb’s Chip Conley. Has the host made them feel at ease with their decision? Has the host made clear how they will solve any issues or problems that arise during the stay? And so on. The experience must match the customers’ vision of what they hired Airbnb to do. The Airbnb storyboards—which have been constantly tweaked and improved since its founding—reflect the importance of the combination of pushes and pulls that drive their customers’ Big Hires and Little Hires.”</p></blockquote><h3 id=\"once-you-figure-out-the-job-function-you-want-to-create-the-desired-experience\">Once you figure out the job function, you want to create the desired experience</h3><p>If you can successfully nail the job, you can transform your company’s brand into a purpose branch such that customers automatically associate with your solutions:</p><ul>  <li>IKEA: finish my apartment today</li>  <li>FedEx: send my documents fast</li>  <li>Apple: assure technology is easy to used and elegantly designed</li>  <li>Google: search anything immediately</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820024-competing-against-luck\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820024-competing-against-luck</a></li></ul>",

            "content_text": " Table of Contents   Photo/Video Sharing Service  File Hosting Service  Chat Service  One more thingPhoto/Video Sharing ServicePhoto/Video Sharing Service lets users upload photos/videos and share them with other users.Similar services  Instagram  Youtube  NetflixRequirements clarifications  Functional requirements:          Users can upload, view, like/dislike, comment, download photos/videos.      Photos/videos stats are recorded: numbers of likes/dislike, views, etc.      Users can upload as many photos/videos as they like.      Users can search for photos/videos titles, and other usernames.      Users can follow other users.      Users can have a News Feed consisting of recent photos/videos from all of their following users.        System requirements:          The system should be highly reliable as any uploaded photo/video should never be lost.      Consistency can take a hit in the interest of availability. It’s fine if an user doesn’t see a photo/video or new changes for a while.      The system should be read-heavy as low latency is expected while viewing photos/videos.      Component Design  Image Hosting Service uses Object Storage Service to store actual photos/videos and Metadata Storage to store metadata information about the photos/videos.          Each uploaded photo/video will be pushed to a Queue to be dequeued later for encoding, thumbnail generation, and storage.      Each uploaded photo/video will be run against a matching algorithm (e.g., Block Matching, Phase Correlation, etc.) to find duplications. Then we can either stop the upload to use the existing copy or intelligently divide the it into smaller chunks and upload the missing parts.        Object Storage Service uses distributed file storages such as HDFS or S3.  Metadata Storage uses SQL databases as we need to store photos/videos metadata as well as their owners and followers.  There are 2 ways we can partition metadata information in this case:          Partitioning based on User’s ID so that all photos/videos of a user is on the same shard. Different issues with this approach include:                  Some users have a lot of photos/videos compared to others, thus making the distribution unbalanced.          All photos/videos of a user might not fit on on shard, thus making distributing onto different shards resource-expensive.          Storing all photos/videos of a user on a shard makes the user’s shard a single point of failure.                    Partitioning based on Photo/Video’s ID will fix all above problems, though we have to query all partitions to find photos/videos of a user and aggregate them, which can result in higher latencies.                  To improve performance, we can introduce cache to store hot photos/videos in front of partitions.          To have a more intelligent cache, we can go with 80/20 rule where 20% photos/videos generating 80% read traffic, we can try to cache 20% of daily read volume from each shard.                      To create a New Feed for a given user, we need to fetch the latest photos/videos of one following users.          One way to do so is to pre-generate users’ New Feeds continuously and storing them in a separate table. Whenever a request comes, we will query that table.      We can pull the New Feeds on a regular basis or whenever they need it. However, new data might not be shown until a request is issued.      We can maintain Long Poll requests for receiving updates, though there will be a performance hit for users who have millions of followers.      We can also adopt a hybrid approach where we only maintain Long Poll requests for users who has a small number of followers.        Cache Service can be added to cache metadata informations/hot database rows.  CDN is also be used so that photos/videos can be served faster and more cost effective.File Hosting ServiceFile Hosting Service enables users to store data on remote servers that are accessible through the Internet.Similar services  Dropbox  Google DriveRequirements clarifications  Functional requirements:          Users can upload, view, download their files from any device.      Users can share files with others.      Files are sync automatically among devices.      Large files are supported.      Offline editing is supported.        System requirements:          The system should be highly reliable as any uploaded file should never be lost.      The system is both read and write heavy.      Component Design  Client Application monitors user’s local workspace and syncs all files with our remote Storage Service. It can be broken into 3 parts as follows:          Chunk Service is responsible for splitting/reconstructing files into/from smaller chunks. It retries only failed chunks as well as uploads only updated chunks, thus saving bandwidth and synchronization time.      Metadata Storage keeps track of all the files, their versions, location in the file system.      Management Service monitors the local workspace, distributes work load to Chunk Service, updates Metadata Storage about the modified changes, and communicates with the remote Synchronization Service on the uploading/downloading changes as well as communicating with other Client Applications (Web, Mobile, Desktop).        Synchronization Service notifies clients about different changes for synchronization and applies these changes to them. It also takes advantages of Chunk Service to intelligently upload/download only updated bits of files.  Since the system is read and write heavy as the Synchronization Service has to deal with a high number of clients pulling/pushing at the same time, a Message Queue is introduced to balance its load.  Metadata Storage keeps metadata of files, their owners and followers in a database of choice.          A relational database is more preferable as it natively supports ACID properties, which is critical in our case.        Block Storage stores chunks of files uploaded by user.  Cache Service can be added to cache hot chunks.Chat ServiceChat Service lets users chat with their friends both from their phones and its website.Similar services  MessengerRequirements clarifications  Functional requirements:          Users can have one-one-one conversations with others.      Users can others online/offline status.      Users can have almost real-time chat experience with minimum latency.      Users can chat in groups.      Users are notified of new messages when they are back online.        System requirements:          The system should be highly reliable as chat history should never be lost.      The system is both read and write heavy.      Component Design  To efficiently send/receive messages, a client can keep a connection with Chat Service using WebSocket.          Chat Servers are the building block of Chat Service. They handle all users’ requests, read/write from the database. Depending on the load, we can scale up by adding more Chat Servers when needed.      To maintain the sequencing of the messages, Chat Service can keep a increasing sequence/version number with every message for each client.      To keep track of user’s online/offline status, Chat Service can broadcast online status of a user to other relevant users.      To enable group chat functionality, we can define a group chat object that maintain a list of users in a separate table in the database.      If an user/receiver is offline, Chat Service can store the message and retry sending it once the receiver connects. Alternatively, Chat Service can talk to Notification Service to handle the delivery process and enable push notification on user’s devices.        Load Balancer tells us which Chat Server holds the connection to which user by holding a map of users’ ID to their Chat Servers.          It assigns each user to a Chat Server based on the hash of their user’s ID.      It forwards users’ messages to their Chat Servers.        Storage Service uses HBase database for several reasons:          Since we have a huge number of small messages that needed to be written in the database as well as query them sequentially in range, HBase is a good choice as it supports a very high rate of small updates and fetching a range of records quickly.      Relational database like MySQL or NoSQL like MongoDB is not a good fit because we can’t afford to read/write every time user receives/sends a message.        We can partition based on the hash of user’s ID so that all messages of a user are on the same database. This also makes it fast to fetch chat history of any user.  We can cache a few recent messages in a few recent conversations of each user. Since all user’s messages are on one shard, the cache should also be on the same machine too.One more thingLet me know if you have any question/thought/feedback in the comment section below.References:  https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview",

Different issues with this approach include:        <ul>          <li>Some users have a lot of photos/videos compared to others, thus making the distribution unbalanced.</li>          <li>All photos/videos of a user might not fit on on shard, thus making distributing onto different shards resource-expensive.</li>          <li>Storing all photos/videos of a user on a shard makes the user’s shard a single point of failure.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Partitioning based on Photo/Video’s ID will fix all above problems, though we have to query all partitions to find photos/videos of a user and aggregate them, which can result in higher latencies.        <ul>          <li>To improve performance, we can introduce cache to store hot photos/videos in front of partitions.</li>          <li>To have a more intelligent cache, we can go with 80/20 rule where 20% photos/videos generating 80% read traffic, we can try to cache 20% of daily read volume from each shard.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>To create a New Feed for a given user, we need to fetch the latest photos/videos of one following users.    <ul>      <li>One way to do so is to pre-generate users’ New Feeds continuously and storing them in a separate table.

            "content_text": " Table of Contents   Viral Marketing  Public Relations (PR)  Unconventional PR  Search Engine Marketing (SEM)  Social and Display Ads  Offline Ads  Search Engine Optimization (SEO)  Content Marketing  Email Marketing  Engineering as Marketing  Target Market Blogs  Business Development (BD)  Sales  Affiliate Programs  Existing Platforms  Trade Shows  Offline Events  Speaking Engagements  Community BuildingViral MarketingViral marketing is the process of getting your existing users to refer others to your product.It can come from different forms:  Pure word of mouth: people naturally tell people about your product.  Inherent virality: people can only get value by inviting others (chat app, social media app).  Collaboration: the product becomes more valuable when used collaboratively (Google Docs).  Embedded communication from the product (Apple’s “Sent from my iPhone”).  Incentive (refer friends to get more space on DropBox).  Embedded buttons &amp; widgets (Youtube’s embedded videos, Facebook’s Like button).  Social networks.Public Relations (PR)PR focus on getting coverage from traditional media like news, newspapers, magazines. Most makemoney from ads, meaning the more view they have, the better. So if you have a compelling story,they want to hear from you.Top news get stories from smaller news or blogs. That said, to target these effectively, start smalland pitch to niche blogs or ones who often get picked up by larger ones like TechCrunch, Lifehacker,Hacker News, Reddit, and so on.Follow influencers in your industry and target blogs they often link to. Ask them for comment/feedbackon your product, and also to share it with their audience if possible.Figure out specific reporters covering your market and build relationship with them (read their articles,comment, offer help). Pitch when you have a compelling story (raising money, launching products, hittinga usage barrier). Refer to the book for pitch templates.Unconventional PRThere are two types of unconventional PR:  Publicly stunt: Richard Branson dressing like a woman, DuckDuckGo’s billboard in Google’sbackyard highlighting its privacy focus, Dollar Shave Club’s viral video.  Customer appreciation: sending gits, hand-written notes to customers, contests and giveaways,having amazing customer support.Unconventional PR is really effective if done right.Search Engine Marketing (SEM)SEM refers to placing advertisements on search engine like Google. You can use SEM to test productpositioning even before you build it.3 terminologies to focus on are:  Click-Through Rate (CTR): if 100 people see your ad, 3 of them click, your CTR is 3%.  Cost per Click (CPC): amount it costs to buy a click.  Cost per Acquisition (CPA): amount it costs to acquire a customer.The higher your CTR is, the higher quality your ad is, the better placement and pricing you can have.If your CPC is $1, 10% of people click on your ad and make a purchase, your CPA is$1/10% = $10. If your product costs $1 and it costs you $10 to acquire a customer, SEM might not worth it.Social and Display AdsDisplay Ads are ones you see on websites all over the Internet where they are run by ad networks.  Large Networks: Google Display Network, Advertising.com.  Niche Networks: BuySell Ads.  Direct Networks: ask sites owners to place your ads.To know the ads your competitors are running, use tools like MixRank, Adbeat. To determine whethera site’s audience is the right fit, use tools like Alexa, Quantcast.Social Ads is when you use social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, reddit) to generate interests,awareness, start a conversation, deliver a message, build an audience rather than conversion purposes(completing a sale, generating sign-up).Offline AdsThere are many kinds of offline ads, such as TV, radio, magazines, newspapers, billboards, direct mail.The most important factor to consider while making an offline ads purchase is the demographics.You can run cheap tests by targeting local markets first and scale up to national ones. To track it,use unique codes or web addresses.Search Engine Optimization (SEO)SEO is the process of improving your ranking in search engines.Moz’s The Beginner’s Guide to SEO is a good start for beginners.SEO comes down to two things: contents and links.  The more aligned your content is with the keywords, the better it will rank.  The more links you can get from credible and varying sources, the better it will rank. This can be achievedvia PR, content marketing, and so on.Content MarketingBlogging is proven to be a great way to promote your product. Having a strong blog can positively impactother traction channels as well.Some use their blogs as a marketing platform before they even have a product.Some use their blogs as their main channel for customers acquisition.Other than blogging, courses, ebooks, infographics,… are also be used in content marketing.  “In the early days, it’s unlikely that your blog will see much traffic, regardless of content quality.Even Unbounce was receiving less than 800 monthly visits after six months of consistently putting out content.It took a while for them to grow to 20,000 monthly visitors.”One of the best way to grow your audience is to do guest posting on popular blogs.To succeed, you have to create quality content and publish consistently.  Write about problems your target customers have.  Use data from your product to produce in-depth posts.Email MarketingEmail marketing works best when it’s personalized as they sit next to email updates from friends and family in yourcustomer’s inbox.Email can be used in all stages of the customer lifecycle:  Finding customers: include an email list in your blog, offer materials over email, and so on.  Engaging customers: what you really want is an email list of active users. What it means depends on your product.For Dropbox, it means uploading at least 1 file. For Twitter, it means sending out a tweet or following at least 5 people.  Retaining customers: send out lifecycle emails to slowly expose customers to new features, weekly summary,…  Upselling cusomters.  Generating referrals.Checkout Copyhackers for copywriting tips.Engineering as MarketingBuild useful tools and resources to reach more people. For example, HubSpot built a free marketing review tool, Marketing Grader,to automate the process of evaluating websites’ marketing effectiveness and at the same time build a bigger customer base.The key features of these tools are that they’re free, very to easy use, and an immediate value.Target Market BlogsTargeting blogs your customer read is one of the most effective way to get your first customers.Mint used this strategy to acquire 20k sign up before they launched:  They got several blogs to write about them.  They sponsored blogs to put ads.  They partnered with larger sites like The Motley Fool.  They asked people on their pre-launch list to share in return for priority product access.To find influential bloggers, can search for “top blogs/best blogs for x” in search engines, Youtube, social media.Business Development (BD)BD focuses on exchanging value through partnerships. Some of the major types are:  Standard partnership: two parties work together to leverage each or both products (Nike+ is the result of Apple and Nike).  Join venture: two parties work together to create a new product offering (Starbucks Frappuccino is the result of Starbucks and Pepsi).  Licensing: an upstart can use a stronger branch to have more credibility.  Distribution deal: one party provides a service to other in return for access to potential customers (Groupon work with restaurants to offer discounts to their mailing list).SalesSales is the process of generating leads and converting them into paying customers. It works best for high-priced products.For more information, refer to the book as well as The Mom Test.Affiliate ProgramsAn affiliate program is an arrangement where you pay people to perform a certain action. Some of the major categories are:  Coupon/deal: offer discounts and take a sale cut (Amazon).  Loyalty program: offer cash back on purchases made through partnered networks (Upromise, Ebates).  Aggregator: aggregate products from retailers.  Email list.  Niche sites.Your ability to use affiliate programs effectively depends on how much you’re willing to pay out of pocket to acquire acustomer.  Use affiliate networks such as ClickBank, Commission Junction, Pepperjam,…  Create your own: even though you don’t have to pay for affiliates in cash, you have to recruit partners yourself.Existing PlatformsExisting platforms are websites, apps with huge number of users (Apple App Store, Google add-ons/extensions).  For app stores, you want to get high ranking or featured.  For social platform, you want to focus on missing features.Trade ShowsTrade shows allow companies to show their products in person.Look at how other companies do it and decide yourself.Offline EventsConferences are the most popular type of offline events. Alongside, throwing parties is a successful strategy to attractand reward prospective customers.Meetups are also good ways to build local communities.Speaking EngagementsIf you’re a good fit for a event, you’re doing the event organizers by presenting.Community Building  “Community building can give you traction by magnifying your essential purpose, building a core asset,creating evangelists for your service, contributing to product development and even giving you a hiring pool.”References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22091581-traction",

Refer to the book for pitch templates.</p><h2 id=\"unconventional-pr\">Unconventional PR</h2><p>There are two types of unconventional PR:</p><ul>  <li>Publicly stunt: Richard Branson dressing like a woman, DuckDuckGo’s billboard in Google’sbackyard highlighting its privacy focus, Dollar Shave Club’s viral video.</li>  <li>Customer appreciation: sending gits, hand-written notes to customers, contests and giveaways,having amazing customer support.</li></ul><p>Unconventional PR is really effective if done right.</p><h2 id=\"search-engine-marketing-sem\">Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h2><p>SEM refers to placing advertisements on search engine like Google. You can use SEM to test productpositioning even before you build it.</p><p>3 terminologies to focus on are:</p><ul>  <li>Click-Through Rate (CTR): if 100 people see your ad, 3 of them click, your CTR is 3%.</li>  <li>Cost per Click (CPC): amount it costs to buy a click.</li>  <li>Cost per Acquisition (CPA): amount it costs to acquire a customer.</li></ul><p>The higher your CTR is, the higher quality your ad is, the better placement and pricing you can have.</p><p>If your CPC is $1, 10% of people click on your ad and <em>make a purchase</em>, your CPA is$1/10% = $10. If your product costs $1 and it costs you $10 to acquire a customer, SEM might not worth it.</p><h2 id=\"social-and-display-ads\">Social and Display Ads</h2><p>Display Ads are ones you see on websites all over the Internet where they are run by ad networks.</p><ul>  <li>Large Networks: Google Display Network, Advertising.com.</li>  <li>Niche Networks: BuySell Ads.</li>  <li>Direct Networks: ask sites owners to place your ads.</li></ul><p>To know the ads your competitors are running, use tools like MixRank, Adbeat. To determine whethera site’s audience is the right fit, use tools like Alexa, Quantcast.</p><p>Social Ads is when you use social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, reddit) to generate interests,awareness, start a conversation, deliver a message, build an audience rather than conversion purposes(completing a sale, generating sign-up).</p><h2 id=\"offline-ads\">Offline Ads</h2><p>There are many kinds of offline ads, such as TV, radio, magazines, newspapers, billboards, direct mail.The most important factor to consider while making an offline ads purchase is the demographics.</p><p>You can run cheap tests by targeting local markets first and scale up to national ones. To track it,use unique codes or web addresses.</p><h2 id=\"search-engine-optimization-seo\">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2><p>SEO is the process of improving your ranking in search engines.</p><p><a href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo\">Moz’s The Beginner’s Guide to SEO</a> is a good start for beginners.</p><p>SEO comes down to two things: contents and links.</p><ul>  <li>The more aligned your content is with the keywords, the better it will rank.</li>  <li>The more links you can get from credible and varying sources, the better it will rank. This can be achievedvia PR, content marketing, and so on.</li></ul><h2 id=\"content-marketing\">Content Marketing</h2><p>Blogging is proven to be a great way to promote your product. Having a strong blog can positively impactother traction channels as well.</p><p>Some use their blogs as a marketing platform before they even have a product.Some use their blogs as their main channel for customers acquisition.</p><p>Other than blogging, courses, ebooks, infographics,… are also be used in content marketing.</p><blockquote>  <p>“In the early days, it’s unlikely that your blog will see much traffic, regardless of content quality.Even Unbounce was receiving less than 800 monthly visits after six months of consistently putting out content.It took a while for them to grow to 20,000 monthly visitors.”</p></blockquote><p>One of the best way to grow your audience is to do guest posting on popular blogs.</p><p>To succeed, you have to create quality content and <strong><a href=\"/james-clear-on-writing-consistently\">publish consistently</a></strong>.</p><ul>  <li>Write about problems your target customers have.</li>  <li>Use data from your product to produce in-depth posts.</li></ul><h2 id=\"email-marketing\">Email Marketing</h2><p>Email marketing works best when it’s personalized as they sit next to email updates from friends and family in yourcustomer’s inbox.</p><p>Email can be used in all stages of the customer lifecycle:</p><ul>  <li>Finding customers: include an email list in your blog, offer materials over email, and so on.</li>  <li>Engaging customers: what you really want is an email list of <strong>active users</strong>. What it means depends on your product.For Dropbox, it means uploading at least 1 file. For Twitter, it means sending out a tweet or following at least 5 people.</li>  <li>Retaining customers: send out lifecycle emails to slowly expose customers to new features, weekly summary,…</li>  <li>Upselling cusomters.</li>  <li>Generating referrals.</li></ul><p>Checkout Copyhackers for copywriting tips.</p><h2 id=\"engineering-as-marketing\">Engineering as Marketing</h2><p>Build useful tools and resources to reach more people. For example, HubSpot built a free marketing review tool, Marketing Grader,to automate the process of evaluating websites’ marketing effectiveness and at the same time build a bigger customer base.</p><p>The key features of these tools are that they’re free, very to easy use, and an immediate value.</p><h2 id=\"target-market-blogs\">Target Market Blogs</h2><p>Targeting blogs your customer read is one of the most effective way to get your first customers.</p><p>Mint used this strategy to acquire 20k sign up before they launched:</p><ul>  <li>They got several blogs to write about them.</li>  <li>They sponsored blogs to put ads.</li>  <li>They partnered with larger sites like The Motley Fool.</li>  <li>They asked people on their pre-launch list to share in return for priority product access.</li></ul><p>To find influential bloggers, can search for “top blogs/best blogs for x” in search engines, Youtube, social media.</p><h2 id=\"business-development-bd\">Business Development (BD)</h2><p>BD focuses on exchanging value through partnerships. Some of the major types are:</p><ul>  <li>Standard partnership: two parties work together to leverage each or both products (Nike+ is the result of Apple and Nike).</li>  <li>Join venture: two parties work together to create a new product offering (Starbucks Frappuccino is the result of Starbucks and Pepsi).</li>  <li>Licensing: an upstart can use a stronger branch to have more credibility.</li>  <li>Distribution deal: one party provides a service to other in return for access to potential customers (Groupon work with restaurants to offer discounts to their mailing list).</li></ul><h2 id=\"sales\">Sales</h2><p>Sales is the process of generating leads and converting them into paying customers. It works best for high-priced products.</p><p>For more information, refer to the book as well as <a href=\"/the-mom-test\">The Mom Test</a>.</p><h2 id=\"affiliate-programs\">Affiliate Programs</h2><p>An affiliate program is an arrangement where you pay people to perform a certain action. Some of the major categories are:</p><ul>  <li>Coupon/deal: offer discounts and take a sale cut (Amazon).</li>  <li>Loyalty program: offer cash back on purchases made through partnered networks (Upromise, Ebates).</li>  <li>Aggregator: aggregate products from retailers.</li>  <li>Email list.</li>  <li>Niche sites.</li></ul><p>Your ability to use affiliate programs effectively depends on how much you’re willing to pay out of pocket to acquire acustomer.</p><ul>  <li>Use affiliate networks such as ClickBank, Commission Junction, Pepperjam,…</li>  <li>Create your own: even though you don’t have to pay for affiliates in cash, you have to recruit partners yourself.</li></ul><h2 id=\"existing-platforms\">Existing Platforms</h2><p>Existing platforms are websites, apps with huge number of users (Apple App Store, Google add-ons/extensions).</p><ul>  <li>For app stores, you want to get high ranking or featured.</li>  <li>For social platform, you want to focus on missing features.</li></ul><h2 id=\"trade-shows\">Trade Shows</h2><p>Trade shows allow companies to show their products in person.</p><p>Look at how other companies do it and decide yourself.</p><h2 id=\"offline-events\">Offline Events</h2><p>Conferences are the most popular type of offline events. Alongside, throwing parties is a successful strategy to attractand reward prospective customers.</p><p>Meetups are also good ways to build local communities.</p><h2 id=\"speaking-engagements\">Speaking Engagements</h2><p>If you’re a good fit for a event, you’re doing the event organizers by presenting.</p><h2 id=\"community-building\">Community Building</h2><blockquote>  <p>“Community building can give you traction by magnifying your essential purpose, building a core asset,creating evangelists for your service, contributing to product development and even giving you a hiring pool.”</p></blockquote><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22091581-traction\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22091581-traction</a></li></ul>",

            "content_text": "Hi friends,Let me confess. I’ve always been struggling to set goals and achieve them consistently.I’ve tried multiple goal setting methods and habit apps in the past but normally I would find thempretty complicated after 1-2 uses. However, since I heard about James Clear’s GoalSetting Method, I’ve been using it actively since.Personally, I think it’s a super clean, simple, yet effective way to set better goals using 4 main strategies:  Besides asking “What do you want to achieve?”, it’s worthwhile to figure out “What sacrifices do you need to take in order to achieve your goal?”. For example, if your goal is to get stronger, your sacrifices would be spending 3-6 hours every week after work to exercise consistently no matter how tired you are. At the end of the day, the hard part is to accept the sacrifices required to achieve your goal.  Instead of focusing on goal setting alone, focus on designing a good system. For example, if your goal is to get stronger, your system could be to exercise 3 times a week and eat healthy every day.   For each day that you make a progress, you would want to note it on a calendar consistently. You’ll have a chain after a few days. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks done.   Finally, only by measuring and clear tracking can you verify if you’re getting better. For example, if your goal is to run 10 miles after 2 months and your system is to run every day, you can start with a version that is incredibly easy, which is to run for 5 miles. Each time, you increase it in an incredibly small way such as 5.1 miles, then 5.2 miles, and so on. If you’re able to increase 0.1 miles each time, by the second months, you could cross out your goal to run 10 miles easily. For the longest time, I’ve been using the above method on a piece a paper or a spreadsheet. Until recently I came up with the idea of putting together an app that helps me keep track of them better. Below are several screenshots of what the app looks like and how it works.For more information on how it works, feel free to check it out at Motion.If you have any questions/comments/feedbacks, please let me know.

Automate testing: unit test, integration test, end-to-end test.          Allow quick recovery rollback strategy.          Set up details monitoring                      Scalability describes a system’s ability to cope with increased load.          Describing load: requests per second, read/write radio, active users, cache hit rate,…      Describing performance:                  When you increase a load parameter, keep system resources unchanged, how is performance affected?          When you increase a load parameter, how much do you increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?                    Approaches for coping with load:                  Scaling up (vertical scaling): move to a more powerful machine.          Scaling out (horizontal scaling): distribute the load across different machines.                      Maintainability focuses on 3 design principles:          Operability: make it easy for operation teams to keep the system running smoothly.                  Provide monitoring system health.          Support for automation and integration tools.          Have Good documentation.                    Simplicity: make it easy for new engineers to understand the system.                  Provide good abstraction layers that allow us to extract parts of a large system into well-defined, reusable components.                    Evolvability: make it easy for engineers to make changes.                  Follow agile approach.                    Data models and query languages.  Data started out being represented as one big tree, though it wasn’t good for representing many-to-many relationships models, so the relational model was invented.  However, some applications didn’t fit well into the relational model, non-relational NoSQL was born:          Document database: self-contained documents, rare relationships between one model and another.      Graph database: anything is related to everything.      Storage and retrieval.  Data structres that power your database:          Hash indexes:                  Basically key-value pairs where each key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file.          Can also split it into smaller chunks/segments for easy storing.          Even though it’s easy to understand and implement, it has memory constrains that the hash table must fit in memory. Also range queries are not efficient since hashed keys are not put next to each other.                    Sorted String Table (SSTable) and Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-trees):                  SSTable maintains a list of key-value pairs that is sorted by key.          The table can also be split into smaller segments and merging is simple as it is sorted.          Maintaining a sorted structure on disk is possible, though keeping it in memory is easy as we can use a tree data structure such as Red-Black trees or AVL trees (memtable).          If the database crashes, memtable might be lost though we can keep a separate log for it, inspired by LSM-tree indexing structure.                    B-trees:                  Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups and range queries.          Instead of breaking down the database into variable-size segments and always writing sequentially, B-trees break into fixed-size blocks/pages and reading/writing one page at a time.          Every modification is first written to a write-ahead log (WAL) so that the index can be restored to a consistent state after a crash.                      Transactional processing or analytic?          The basic database access pattern is similar to processing business transaction (create, read, update, delete record), as known as online transaction processing (OLTP).      Since OLTP are expected to be highly available as they’re critical to the operation of the business, they’re reluctant to let business analysts run ad-hoc analytic queries.      A data warehouse is a separate database that analysts can query without affecting OLTP operations.                  Data is extracted from OLTP databases, transformed into an analysis-friendly schema, cleaned up, and then loaded into the data warehouse.          A big advantage of using a separate data warehouse is that the data warehouse can be optimized for analytic access patterns.          2 popular schemas that data are stored in are star schema, snowflake schema.                      Column-oriented storage:          In most OLTP databases, storage is laid out in a row-oriented fashion: all the values from one row of a table are stored next to each other. In the column-oriented storage, all the values are stored from each column together instead.      Since the sequences of values for each column are often look repetitive (distinct values are small), they often lend themselves well to compression.        Aggregation:          Since data warehouse queries often involve an aggregate function, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN or MAX, we can cache these aggregated values that are used often.      One way of creating such a cache is a materialized view, while data cube is a special case.      Encoding and evolution.  Formats for encoding data.          Many languages come with built-in support for encoding in-memory objects to byte sequences though they are not used because it’s language-specific and don’t show good performance.      JSON, XML are widely known, supported due to the fact that they are simple, can be used by many languages and have built-in support for web browser. However, there are a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers and they also don’t support binary encoding (compact, efficient encoding). Hence the development of MessagePack, BSON, BJSON, and so on.      Thrift and Protocol Buffers are binary encoding libraries that require a schema for any data that is encoded, that is clearly defined forward and backward compatibility semantics. They come with a code generation tool that produces classes that implement the schema in various programming languages.      There’s is also a binary encoding library Avro that is good for processing large files as in Hadoop’s use cases.        Modes of data flow (from one process to anther).          Databases: the process writing to the database encodes the data, and the process reading from the database decodes it.      Calls to services, REST and RPC (gRPC): client encodes a request, server decodes the request and encodes a response, and client finally decodes the response.      Asynchronous message-passing (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka): nodes send each other messages that are encoded by the sender and decoded by the recipient.      Replication, partitioning/sharding, transactions, and what it means to achieve consistency and consensus in a distributed system.Replication.  Why would you want to replicate data?          Reduce latency by keeping data geographically close to users.      Increase availability.      Increase throughput.        2 types of algorithms are leader-based replication and leaderless replication.  Leader-based replication:          Workflow:                  One of the replicas is designed as the leader while others are followers.          Client must send write request to the leader though can send read request to both leader and followers.          After the leader writes data to its local storage, it sends the changes to all of its followers so that they can self apply accordingly.                    An important detail of a replicated system is whether the replication happens synchronously or asynchronously.                  Even though the advantage of synchronous replication is that followers is that the follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date data, if the synchronous follower doesn’t respond, the write cannot be processed, thus the leader must block all writes and wait until one is available again.          It is impractical for all followers to be synchronous so leader-based replication is often configured to be completely asynchronous.                    From time to time, you need to set up new followers to increase the number of replicas, or to replace failed nodes. This can usually be done without downtime by maintaining a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database.      If the follower goes down, it can recover quite easily from its logs that it has received from the leader. Later when it’s able to talk to the leader again, it can request all the missing data and catch up to the leader.      If the leader goes down, a possible approach is failover: one of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader using a consensus algorithm, clients and followers need to be configured to talk to the new leader. However, failover can go wrong as well (two leaders, choosing the right timeout before the leader is declared dead,…) as there are no easy solutions to these.      Different implementation of replication logs:                  Statement-based replication: the leader logs every write request that it executes, and sends that statement log to its followers. Even though it seems reasonable, non-deterministic function, such as NOW() to get current date and time, is likely to generate a different value on each replica.          Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping: similar to B-tree’s approach where every modification is first written to a WAL, besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it to its followers so that they can build a copy of the exact same data structures as found on the leader.          Logical log replication: allow the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine by using different log formats.          Trigger-based replication: register a trigger to only replicate subset of the data, or from one kind of database to another and so on.                    Replication lags:                  If the user view the data shortly after making the write, new data may have not yet reach the replica. In this case, we need read-after-write consistency, meaning we can read from the leader first, so that user always see their latest changes.          If a user makes several reads from different replicas and there’s lagging among replicas, they might not see the correct data. Monotonic reads guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen by making sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica.          If some followers are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the answer before they see the question. Preventing this kind of anomaly requires consistent prefix reads so that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.                      Multi-leader replication:          Use cases:                  Multi-datacenter operation: each datacenter has its own leader. This can improve perfomance, tolerance of datacenter outages though same data may be concurrently modified in two different datacenters, and those write conflicts must be resolved.          Client with offline operation: every client has a local database that acts as a leader, and there is an asynchronous multi-leader replication process (sync) between the replicas on all of your clients.          Real-time collaborative editing: when one user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other users who are editing the same document.                    Handling write conflicts:                  A write conflict can be caused by two leaders concurrently updating the same record. In a single-leader scenario, it can’t happen since the second leader will wait for the first write or abort it. In a multi-leader one, both writes are successful and the conflict can only be detected asynchronously at later point in time.          The simplest way for dealing with multi-leader write conflicts is to avoid them by making sure all writes go through the same designated leader.          Since there is no defined ordering of writes in a multi-leader database, it’s unclear what the final value should be in all replicas. A number of ways to converge to the final value include giving each writes a unique ID and picking one with the highest ID as the winner, somehow merging values together,…                    Topologies: communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another.                  The most general topology is all-to-all where every leader sends its writes to every other leader. Other popular ones are circular and star topology.          A problem with circular and star topologies is that if one node fails, the path is broken, resulting in some nodes are not connected others.          Even though all-to-all topologies avoid a single point of failure, they can also have issues that some replications are faster and can overtake others. A technique called version vectors can be used to order these events correctly.                      Leaderless replication: client writes to several replicas or a coordinator node does this on behalf of the client.          A failover does not exist in a leaderless replication. If a node is down, client writes to all available replicas in parallel, verify if they’re successful and simply ignore the one unavailable replica. Read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel to avoid stale values.      To ensure all up-to-date data is copied to every replica, two often used mechanisms are read repair (make requests to several nodes in parallel and detect stale values using versioning), anti-entropy process (background process that constantly looks for differences in the data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to another).      If there are n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least r nodes for each read, as long as w + r &gt; n, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading, because at least one of the r nodes we’re reading from must be up-to-date. However, there’re still edge cases when stale values are return:                  Using a sloppy quorum.          Two writes happen concurrently, or with read.          A node carrying a failed value.                    For multi-datacenter operation, some implementation of leaderless replication keeps all communication between clients and database nodes local to one datacenter, so n describes the number of replicas within one datacenter. Cross-datacenter replication works similarly to multi-leader replication.      Handling concurrent write conflicts:                  Last write wins: attach a timestamp to each write, pick the biggest timestamp as the most ‘recent’, and discard any writes with a lower timestamp.          Version vectors:                          For a singple replica, the algorithm works as follow:                                  A server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written.                  A client must read a key before writing. When a client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read.                  When the server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below but it must keep all values with a higher version number.                                            For multiple replicas:                                  We need to use a version number per replica as well as per key.                  Each replica increments its own version number when processing a write, and also keeps track of the version numbers it has seen from all of the other replicas.                                                                        Partitioning/sharding.  The main reason for partitioning is scalability: partitions can be distributed across many nodes, disks, and so on.  It is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partitions are stored on multiple nodes.  The goal of partitioning is to spread the data and query load evenly across nodes.  Partitioning of key-value data.          One way of partitioning is to assign a continuous range of keys to each partition. However, the downside is that certain patterns can lead to high load.      Another way is to use a hash function to determine the partition for a given key. A downside is the ability to efficiently do range queries as adjacent keys are now scattered across all partitions.        Partitioning and secondary indexes.          Partitioning becomes more complicated if secondary indexes are involved since they don’t identify records uniquely but rather, it’s a way of searching for occurrences of a particular value.      Two main approaches are document-based partitioning and term-based partitioning.      With document-based partitioning, each partition maintains its own secondary indexes covering only the documents in that partition. Since it doesn’t care about other partitions, reading from it can be quite expensive since one need to query all partitions and aggregate everything for more exact results.      With term-based partitioning, rather than each partition having its own secondary index, we can construct a global index that covers data in all partitions. This can make reads more efficient rather than doing scatter/gather over all partitions. The downside is that writes are now slower and more complicated, because a write to a single document may now affect multiple partitions of the index.        Rebalancing partitions as we increase our nodes and machines over time.          Mod N approach is problematic when the number of nodes N changes, most of the keys need to be moved as well.      A simple solution is to create many more partitions than there are nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. If a new node is added, it can steal a few partitions from every existing node.      Rebalancing can be done automatically, though it won’t hurt to have a human in the loop to help prevent operational surprises.        Request routing/service discovery.          After the partitioning and rebalancing, how does the client know which node to connection to?                  Client can talk to any node and forward the request to the appropriate node if needed.          Client can talk to a routing tier that determines the node that should handle the request and forwards it accordingly.                    Transactions.  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID).          Since transactions are often composed of multiple statements, atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single “unit”, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.      Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.      Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other.      Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.        Weak isolation levels.          Database hides concurrency issues from application developers by providing transaction isolation, especially serializable isolation, by guaranteeing that have transactions the same effect as if they ran serially, one at a time without any concurrency.      In practice, serializable isolation has a performance cost and many databases don’t want to pay that price. Instead, they use weaker levels of isolation.      Read committed.                  When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed.          When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed.                    Snapshot isolation or Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC).                  Each transaction read from a consistent snapshot of the database. Each transaction sees the latest data from the time it starts.                    Preventing lost update.                  Lost update can occur if two transations modify the value concurrently that one modification is lost.          2 popular approaches are to use atomic write and locking.                    Preventing write skew and phantoms.                  Write skew is a generalization of lost update. It happens when two transaction update some of the same objects, not just the same object.          Phantom happens while a write in one transaction change the result of a search query in another transaction.          Since multiple objects are involved, atomic single-object or snapshot isolation write doesn’t help as it doesn’t prevent valid conflicting concurrent writes.          A simple and straightforward solution is to use serializable isolation.                      Implementation of serializable isolation.          Actual serial execution.                  The best way to avoid concurrency issue is to execute only one transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread.          The entire transaction is submitted as a stored procedure as the data must be small and fast.                    Two-phase locking (2PL).                  2PL has really strong requirements where writers don’t just block writers, readers also block writers and vice versa.          The big downside is performance as it hasn’t used a lot in practice.                    Serializable snapshot isolation (SSI).                  As serial isolation doesn’t scale well and 2PL doesn’t perform well, SSI is promising since it provides full serializability and has only a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation.          It allows transactions to proceed without blocking. When a transaction wants to commit, it is checked, and aborted if the execution was not serializable.                    Things that may go wrong in a distributed system.  A partial failure is when there are some parts of the system that are broken in some unpredictable ways even though the rest are working fine. And since partial failures are non-deterministic in a sense that your solution might sometimes unpredictably fail, it distributed systems hard to work with.  Unreliable networks.          There are many things could go wrong with a networking request such as your request may have been lost, be waiting in a queue, the remote node may have failed, the response has been lost, delayed, and so on.      Network problem can be surprisingly common in practice.      Timeout is normally a good way to detect a fault. Rather than using a configured constant timeouts, system can automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution.        Unreliable clocks.          Time is tricky since communication is not instantaneous, it takes time for a message to travel from one point to another, and because of variable delayed in network with multiple machines are involved, it’s hard to determine the order of operations.      Modern computers have at least two different kinds of clock:                  A time-of-day clock, which are usually synchronized with Network Time Protocol (NTP), which means that a timestamp from one machine (ideally) means the same as a timestamp on another machine.          A monotonic clock is suitable for measuring a duration such as a timeout or a service’s response time.                    Time-of-day clocks need to be set according to an NTP in order to be useful though this isn’t as reliable as we hope as he quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate, if a computer’s clock differs too much from an NTP server, it may refuse to synchronize, NTP synchronization can only be as good as the network delay, NTP servers could be wrong or misconfigured, the hardware clock is virtualized in virtual machines, and so on.      If you use software that requires synchronized clocks, it is essential that you also carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines.        Knowledge, truth and lies.          A distributed system cannot exclusively rely on a single node, because a node may fail at any time, potentially leaving the system stuck and unable to recover. Instead, many distributed algorithms rely on a quorum where decisions are made by a majority of nodes.      Distributed systems problems become much harder if there is a risk that nodes may lie, such as claiming unreceived messages from other node or sending untrue messages to other nodes, it’s known as Byzantine fault.      Consistency and consensus.  Most replicated databases provide at least eventual consistency, which means that if you stop writing to the database and wait for some unspecified length of time, then eventually all read requests will return the same value. However, this is a very weak guarantee as it doesn’t say anything about when the replicas will converge. Below we’re looking at stronger consistency models and discussing their trade-offs.  Linearizability makes a system appear as if there was only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic.          It is useful in such circumstances:                  A system needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader.          Constraints and uniqueness guarantees in database: user’s username or email must be unique, two people can’t have the same seat on a flight,…          Cross-channel timing dependencies: web server and image resizer communicate both through file storage and a message queue, opening the potential for race conditions,…                    CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem to pick 2 out of 3:                  If the application requires linearizability, some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot process requests while they are disconnected, or unavailable.          If the application does not require linearizability, each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replica.          A better way of phrasing CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned                    Few systems are actually linearizable in practice since most of them concern about their performance and availability.        Ordering guarantees.          In order to maintain causality, you need to know which operation happened before which other operation. One way is to use sequence numbers or timestamps to order events such as Lamport timestamp.      However, in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for usernames, it’s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations as you also need to know when that order is finalized, aka total order broadcast.      Total order broadcast says that if every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other.        Distributed transaction and consensus.          There are several situations in which it is important for nodes to reach consensus such as leader election and atomic commit in database.      2-phase commit (2PC) algorithm is the most common way for achieving atomic transaction commit across multiple nodes.                  2PC uses a new component as a coordinator to manage all nodes.          The application first requests a globally unique transaction ID from the coordinator for transaction.          When the application is ready to commit, the coordinator begins phase 1: send a prepare request to each of the nodes, tagged with the ID, asking them whether they are able to commit.          If all participants reply “yes”, the coordinator sends out a commit request to all nodes in phase 2, while if any of them says “no”, the coordinator sends an abort request.          If the coordinator fails after all participants reply “yes” in phase 1, participants have no way of knowing whether to commit or abort in phase 2. The only way how this can complete is to wait for the coordinator to recover.          Three-phase commit (3PC) has been proposed as alternative to 2PC. However, it assumes a network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times which is not practical in most systems.                    Distributed transactions in practice has mixed reputation. On one hand, they provide an important safety guarantee. On the other hand, it causes operational problems, kill perfomance and so on.                  There are two types of distributed transaction are often conflated: database-internal distributed transactions (distributed databases that support internal transactions among the nodes of that database) and heterogeneous distributed transactions (participants are two or more different technologies).          That said, database-internal distributed transactions can often work quite well though transactions spanning heterogeneous technologies are a lot more challenging.                    The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are Viewstamped Replication (VSR), Paxos, Raft and Zab as most of them provide total order broadcast. However, they’re not used everywhere since they all come with performance costs.      ZooKeeper or etcd implements a consensus algorithm though they are often described as distributed key-value stores. They are not use directly in your application but via some other projects for distributed coordination, work allocation, service discovery, membership services.      Batch and stream processing.Batch processing.  With basic Unix tools (awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, xarg, pipe,…), one can do a lot of powerful data processing jobs. A simple chain of Unix commands can actually perform surprisingly well as it can easily scale to large datasets, without running out of memory.  MapReduce is a bit like Unix tools, but distributed across potentially thousands of machines.          While Unix tools use stdin and stdout as input and output, MapReduce jobs read and write files on a distributed filesystem like Google’s GFS.      As the name suggested, 2 callback functions in MapReduce are map and reduce. Map extracts they key and value from the input record while reduce iterates over that collection of values with the same key and produce zero or more outputs. They’re stateless function as they also don’t modify output. Since the input is also bounded, the output is guaranteed to be completed.      The main difference to pipelines of Unix commands is that MapReduce can parallelize a computation across many machines out-of-the-box.      Your code does not need to worry about implementing fault tolerance mechanisms since the framework can guarantee that the final output of a job is the same as if no faults had occurred, even though in reality various tasks perhaps had to be retried.      It’s common for MapReduce jobs to be chained together into workflows, such that the output of one job becomes the input to the next job.      There are several join algorithms for MapReduce such as sort-merge joins, broadcast hash joins, partitioned hash joins that allow us to use joins more efficiently.      Stream processing.  In batch process, the input is bounded that it’s known and have finite size. In reality, a lot of data is unbounded, arrives gradually over time and never complete in any meaningful way, that batch processors must divide and process them in chunks. However, that takes a long time for impatient users. Stream processing is introduced as it simply processes every event as it happens.  An event is generated once by a producer/publisher/sender and processed by multiple consumers/subscribers/recipients.  A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging system: a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers.          A number of messaging systems use direct network communication between producers and consumers, without going via intermediary nodes such as UDP multicast, ZeroMQ, webhooks,…      A widely-used alternative is to send messages via a message broker/message queue. Two types of them are:                  AMQP/JMS-style message brokers: the broker assigned individual messages to consumers, consumers acknowledge when they have been successfully processed.          Log-based message brokers: the broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers messages in the same order while consumers keep their logs.                    When multiple consumers are reading messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are load balancing and fan out.        It’s also useful to think of the writes to a database as a stream that it can capture the changelog, either implicitly through change data capture or explicitly through event sourcing as it also opens up powerful opportunities for integrating systems.          You can keep derived data systems such as search indexes, caches and analytics systems continually up-to-date by consuming the log of changes and applying them to the derived system.      You can even build fresh views onto existing data by starting from scratch and consuming the log of changes from the beginning all the way to the present.        Stream processing has long been used for monitoring purposes, where an organization wants to be alerted if certain things happen. However, other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time.          Complex event processing (CEP) allows you to specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in a stream.      Analytics that are more oriented towards aggregations and statistical metrics over a large number of events are also used.      It can be used to maintain materialized views onto some dataset, so that you can query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying data changes.        Stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine to determine windowing. Even though it’s simple to implement and reason about, it breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.  There are 3 types of join that may appear in stream processes:          Stream-stream joins: matching two events that occur within some window of time.      Stream-table joins: one input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database changelog.      Table-table joins: both input streams are database changelogs where every change on one side is joined with the latest state of the other side.        To tolerate faults, one solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a miniature batch process (microbatching). Other is to use idempotent writes.References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID",

However, there are a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers and they also don’t support binary encoding (compact, efficient encoding). Hence the development of MessagePack, BSON, BJSON, and so on.</li>      <li>Thrift and Protocol Buffers are binary encoding libraries that require a schema for any data that is encoded, that is clearly defined forward and backward compatibility semantics.

This can usually be done without downtime by maintaining a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database.</li>      <li>If the follower goes down, it can recover quite easily from its logs that it has received from the leader. Later when it’s able to talk to the leader again, it can request all the missing data and catch up to the leader.</li>      <li>If the leader goes down, a possible approach is failover: one of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader using a consensus algorithm, clients and followers need to be configured to talk to the new leader. However, failover can go wrong as well (two leaders, choosing the right timeout before the leader is declared dead,…) as there are no easy solutions to these.</li>      <li>Different implementation of replication logs:        <ul>          <li>Statement-based replication: the leader logs every write request that it executes, and sends that statement log to its followers. Even though it seems reasonable, non-deterministic function, such as NOW() to get current date and time, is likely to generate a different value on each replica.</li>          <li>Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping: similar to B-tree’s approach where every modification is first written to a WAL, besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it to its followers so that they can build a copy of the exact same data structures as found on the leader.</li>          <li>Logical log replication: allow the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine by using different log formats.</li>          <li>Trigger-based replication: register a trigger to only replicate subset of the data, or from one kind of database to another and so on.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Replication lags:        <ul>          <li>If the user view the data shortly after making the write, new data may have not yet reach the replica. In this case, we need read-after-write consistency, meaning we can read from the leader first, so that user always see their latest changes.</li>          <li>If a user makes several reads from different replicas and there’s lagging among replicas, they might not see the correct data. Monotonic reads guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen by making sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica.</li>          <li>If some followers are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the answer before they see the question. Preventing this kind of anomaly requires consistent prefix reads so that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Multi-leader replication:    <ul>      <li>Use cases:        <ul>          <li>Multi-datacenter operation: each datacenter has its own leader. This can improve perfomance, tolerance of datacenter outages though same data may be concurrently modified in two different datacenters, and those write conflicts must be resolved.</li>          <li>Client with offline operation: every client has a local database that acts as a leader, and there is an asynchronous multi-leader replication process (sync) between the replicas on all of your clients.</li>          <li>Real-time collaborative editing: when one user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other users who are editing the same document.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Handling write conflicts:        <ul>          <li>A write conflict can be caused by two leaders concurrently updating the same record. In a single-leader scenario, it can’t happen since the second leader will wait for the first write or abort it. In a multi-leader one, both writes are successful and the conflict can only be detected asynchronously at later point in time.</li>          <li>The simplest way for dealing with multi-leader write conflicts is to avoid them by making sure all writes go through the same designated leader.</li>          <li>Since there is no defined ordering of writes in a multi-leader database, it’s unclear what the final value should be in all replicas. A number of ways to converge to the final value include giving each writes a unique ID and picking one with the highest ID as the winner, somehow merging values together,…</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Topologies: communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another.        <ul>          <li>The most general topology is all-to-all where every leader sends its writes to every other leader. Other popular ones are circular and star topology.</li>          <li>A problem with circular and star topologies is that if one node fails, the path is broken, resulting in some nodes are not connected others.</li>          <li>Even though all-to-all topologies avoid a single point of failure, they can also have issues that some replications are faster and can overtake others. A technique called version vectors can be used to order these events correctly.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Leaderless replication: client writes to several replicas or a coordinator node does this on behalf of the client.    <ul>      <li>A failover does not exist in a leaderless replication. If a node is down, client writes to all available replicas in parallel, verify if they’re successful and simply ignore the one unavailable replica. Read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel to avoid stale values.</li>      <li>To ensure all up-to-date data is copied to every replica, two often used mechanisms are read repair (make requests to several nodes in parallel and detect stale values using versioning), anti-entropy process (background process that constantly looks for differences in the data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to another).</li>      <li>If there are n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least r nodes for each read, as long as w + r &gt; n, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading, because at least one of the r nodes we’re reading from must be up-to-date. However, there’re still edge cases when stale values are return:        <ul>          <li>Using a sloppy quorum.</li>          <li>Two writes happen concurrently, or with read.</li>          <li>A node carrying a failed value.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>For multi-datacenter operation, some implementation of leaderless replication keeps all communication between clients and database nodes local to one datacenter, so n describes the number of replicas within one datacenter. Cross-datacenter replication works similarly to multi-leader replication.</li>      <li>Handling concurrent write conflicts:        <ul>          <li>Last write wins: attach a timestamp to each write, pick the biggest timestamp as the most ‘recent’, and discard any writes with a lower timestamp.</li>          <li>Version vectors:            <ul>              <li>For a singple replica, the algorithm works as follow:                <ul>                  <li>A server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written.</li>                  <li>A client must read a key before writing. When a client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read.</li>                  <li>When the server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below but it must keep all values with a higher version number.</li>                </ul>              </li>              <li>For multiple replicas:                <ul>                  <li>We need to use a version number per replica as well as per key.</li>                  <li>Each replica increments its own version number when processing a write, and also keeps track of the version numbers it has seen from all of the other replicas.</li>                </ul>              </li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"partitioningsharding\">Partitioning/sharding.</h3><ul>  <li>The main reason for partitioning is scalability: partitions can be distributed across many nodes, disks, and so on.</li>  <li>It is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partitions are stored on multiple nodes.</li>  <li>The goal of partitioning is to spread the data and query load evenly across nodes.</li>  <li>Partitioning of key-value data.    <ul>      <li>One way of partitioning is to assign a continuous range of keys to each partition. However, the downside is that certain patterns can lead to high load.</li>      <li>Another way is to use a hash function to determine the partition for a given key. A downside is the ability to efficiently do range queries as adjacent keys are now scattered across all partitions.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Partitioning and secondary indexes.    <ul>      <li>Partitioning becomes more complicated if secondary indexes are involved since they don’t identify records uniquely but rather, it’s a way of searching for occurrences of a particular value.</li>      <li>Two main approaches are document-based partitioning and term-based partitioning.</li>      <li>With document-based partitioning, each partition maintains its own secondary indexes covering only the documents in that partition. Since it doesn’t care about other partitions, reading from it can be quite expensive since one need to query all partitions and aggregate everything for more exact results.</li>      <li>With term-based partitioning, rather than each partition having its own secondary index, we can construct a global index that covers data in all partitions. This can make reads more efficient rather than doing scatter/gather over all partitions. The downside is that writes are now slower and more complicated, because a write to a single document may now affect multiple partitions of the index.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Rebalancing partitions as we increase our nodes and machines over time.    <ul>      <li>Mod N approach is problematic when the number of nodes N changes, most of the keys need to be moved as well.</li>      <li>A simple solution is to create many more partitions than there are nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. If a new node is added, it can steal a few partitions from every existing node.</li>      <li>Rebalancing can be done automatically, though it won’t hurt to have a human in the loop to help prevent operational surprises.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Request routing/service discovery.    <ul>      <li>After the partitioning and rebalancing, how does the client know which node to connection to?        <ul>          <li>Client can talk to any node and forward the request to the appropriate node if needed.</li>          <li>Client can talk to a routing tier that determines the node that should handle the request and forwards it accordingly.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"transactions\">Transactions.</h3><ul>  <li>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID).    <ul>      <li>Since transactions are often composed of multiple statements, atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single “unit”, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.</li>      <li>Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.</li>      <li>Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other.</li>      <li>Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Weak isolation levels.    <ul>      <li>Database hides concurrency issues from application developers by providing transaction isolation, especially serializable isolation, by guaranteeing that have transactions the same effect as if they ran serially, one at a time without any concurrency.</li>      <li>In practice, serializable isolation has a performance cost and many databases don’t want to pay that price. Instead, they use weaker levels of isolation.</li>      <li>Read committed.        <ul>          <li>When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed.</li>          <li>When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Snapshot isolation or Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC).        <ul>          <li>Each transaction read from a consistent snapshot of the database. Each transaction sees the latest data from the time it starts.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Preventing lost update.        <ul>          <li>Lost update can occur if two transations modify the value concurrently that one modification is lost.</li>          <li>2 popular approaches are to use atomic write and locking.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Preventing write skew and phantoms.        <ul>          <li>Write skew is a generalization of lost update. It happens when two transaction update <strong>some</strong> of the same objects, not just the same object.</li>          <li>Phantom happens while a write in one transaction change the result of a search query in another transaction.</li>          <li>Since multiple objects are involved, atomic single-object or snapshot isolation write doesn’t help as it doesn’t prevent valid conflicting concurrent writes.</li>          <li>A simple and straightforward solution is to use serializable isolation.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Implementation of serializable isolation.    <ul>      <li>Actual serial execution.        <ul>          <li>The best way to avoid concurrency issue is to execute only one transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread.</li>          <li>The entire transaction is submitted as a stored procedure as the data must be small and fast.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Two-phase locking (2PL).        <ul>          <li>2PL has really strong requirements where writers don’t just block writers, readers also block writers and vice versa.</li>          <li>The big downside is performance as it hasn’t used a lot in practice.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Serializable snapshot isolation (SSI).        <ul>          <li>As serial isolation doesn’t scale well and 2PL doesn’t perform well, SSI is promising since it provides full serializability and has only a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation.</li>          <li>It allows transactions to proceed without blocking. When a transaction wants to commit, it is checked, and aborted if the execution was not serializable.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"things-that-may-go-wrong-in-a-distributed-system\">Things that may go wrong in a distributed system.</h3><ul>  <li>A partial failure is when there are some parts of the system that are broken in some unpredictable ways even though the rest are working fine. And since partial failures are non-deterministic in a sense that your solution might sometimes unpredictably fail, it distributed systems hard to work with.</li>  <li>Unreliable networks.    <ul>      <li>There are many things could go wrong with a networking request such as your request may have been lost, be waiting in a queue, the remote node may have failed, the response has been lost, delayed, and so on.</li>      <li>Network problem can be surprisingly common in practice.</li>      <li>Timeout is normally a good way to detect a fault. Rather than using a configured constant timeouts, system can automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Unreliable clocks.    <ul>      <li>Time is tricky since communication is not instantaneous, it takes time for a message to travel from one point to another, and because of variable delayed in network with multiple machines are involved, it’s hard to determine the order of operations.</li>      <li>Modern computers have at least two different kinds of clock:        <ul>          <li>A time-of-day clock, which are usually synchronized with Network Time Protocol (NTP), which means that a timestamp from one machine (ideally) means the same as a timestamp on another machine.</li>          <li>A monotonic clock is suitable for measuring a duration such as a timeout or a service’s response time.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Time-of-day clocks need to be set according to an NTP in order to be useful though this isn’t as reliable as we hope as he quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate, if a computer’s clock differs too much from an NTP server, it may refuse to synchronize, NTP synchronization can only be as good as the network delay, NTP servers could be wrong or misconfigured, the hardware clock is virtualized in virtual machines, and so on.</li>      <li>If you use software that requires synchronized clocks, it is essential that you also carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Knowledge, truth and lies.    <ul>      <li>A distributed system cannot exclusively rely on a single node, because a node may fail at any time, potentially leaving the system stuck and unable to recover. Instead, many distributed algorithms rely on a quorum where decisions are made by a majority of nodes.</li>      <li>Distributed systems problems become much harder if there is a risk that nodes may lie, such as claiming unreceived messages from other node or sending untrue messages to other nodes, it’s known as Byzantine fault.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"consistency-and-consensus\">Consistency and consensus.</h3><ul>  <li>Most replicated databases provide at least eventual consistency, which means that if you stop writing to the database and wait for some unspecified length of time, then eventually all read requests will return the same value. However, this is a very weak guarantee as it doesn’t say anything about when the replicas will converge. Below we’re looking at stronger consistency models and discussing their trade-offs.</li>  <li>Linearizability makes a system appear as if there was only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic.    <ul>      <li>It is useful in such circumstances:        <ul>          <li>A system needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader.</li>          <li>Constraints and uniqueness guarantees in database: user’s username or email must be unique, two people can’t have the same seat on a flight,…</li>          <li>Cross-channel timing dependencies: web server and image resizer communicate both through file storage and a message queue, opening the potential for race conditions,…</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem to pick 2 out of 3:        <ul>          <li>If the application requires linearizability, some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot process requests while they are disconnected, or unavailable.</li>          <li>If the application does not require linearizability, each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replica.</li>          <li>A better way of phrasing CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Few systems are actually linearizable in practice since most of them concern about their performance and availability.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Ordering guarantees.    <ul>      <li>In order to maintain causality, you need to know which operation happened before which other operation. One way is to use sequence numbers or timestamps to order events such as Lamport timestamp.</li>      <li>However, in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for usernames, it’s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations as you also need to know when that order is finalized, aka total order broadcast.</li>      <li>Total order broadcast says that if every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Distributed transaction and consensus.    <ul>      <li>There are several situations in which it is important for nodes to reach consensus such as leader election and atomic commit in database.</li>      <li>2-phase commit (2PC) algorithm is the most common way for achieving atomic transaction commit across multiple nodes.        <ul>          <li>2PC uses a new component as a coordinator to manage all nodes.</li>          <li>The application first requests a globally unique transaction ID from the coordinator for transaction.</li>          <li>When the application is ready to commit, the coordinator begins phase 1: send a prepare request to each of the nodes, tagged with the ID, asking them whether they are able to commit.</li>          <li>If all participants reply “yes”, the coordinator sends out a commit request to all nodes in phase 2, while if any of them says “no”, the coordinator sends an abort request.</li>          <li>If the coordinator fails after all participants reply “yes” in phase 1, participants have no way of knowing whether to commit or abort in phase 2. The only way how this can complete is to wait for the coordinator to recover.</li>          <li>Three-phase commit (3PC) has been proposed as alternative to 2PC. However, it assumes a network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times which is not practical in most systems.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Distributed transactions in practice has mixed reputation. On one hand, they provide an important safety guarantee. On the other hand, it causes operational problems, kill perfomance and so on.        <ul>          <li>There are two types of distributed transaction are often conflated: database-internal distributed transactions (distributed databases that support internal transactions among the nodes of that database) and heterogeneous distributed transactions (participants are two or more different technologies).</li>          <li>That said, database-internal distributed transactions can often work quite well though transactions spanning heterogeneous technologies are a lot more challenging.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are Viewstamped Replication (VSR), Paxos, Raft and Zab as most of them provide total order broadcast. However, they’re not used everywhere since they all come with performance costs.</li>      <li>ZooKeeper or etcd implements a consensus algorithm though they are often described as distributed key-value stores. They are not use directly in your application but via some other projects for distributed coordination, work allocation, service discovery, membership services.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h2 id=\"batch-and-stream-processing\">Batch and stream processing.</h2><h3 id=\"batch-processing\">Batch processing.</h3><ul>  <li>With basic Unix tools (awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, xarg, pipe,…), one can do a lot of powerful data processing jobs. A simple chain of Unix commands can actually perform surprisingly well as it can easily scale to large datasets, without running out of memory.</li>  <li>MapReduce is a bit like Unix tools, but distributed across potentially thousands of machines.    <ul>      <li>While Unix tools use stdin and stdout as input and output, MapReduce jobs read and write files on a distributed filesystem like Google’s GFS.</li>      <li>As the name suggested, 2 callback functions in MapReduce are map and reduce. Map extracts they key and value from the input record while reduce iterates over that collection of values with the same key and produce zero or more outputs. They’re stateless function as they also don’t modify output. Since the input is also bounded, the output is guaranteed to be completed.</li>      <li>The main difference to pipelines of Unix commands is that MapReduce can parallelize a computation across many machines out-of-the-box.</li>      <li>Your code does not need to worry about implementing fault tolerance mechanisms since the framework can guarantee that the final output of a job is the same as if no faults had occurred, even though in reality various tasks perhaps had to be retried.</li>      <li>It’s common for MapReduce jobs to be chained together into workflows, such that the output of one job becomes the input to the next job.</li>      <li>There are several join algorithms for MapReduce such as sort-merge joins, broadcast hash joins, partitioned hash joins that allow us to use joins more efficiently.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h3 id=\"stream-processing\">Stream processing.</h3><ul>  <li>In batch process, the input is bounded that it’s known and have finite size. In reality, a lot of data is unbounded, arrives gradually over time and never complete in any meaningful way, that batch processors must divide and process them in chunks. However, that takes a long time for impatient users. Stream processing is introduced as it simply processes every event as it happens.</li>  <li>An event is generated once by a producer/publisher/sender and processed by multiple consumers/subscribers/recipients.</li>  <li>A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging system: a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers.    <ul>      <li>A number of messaging systems use direct network communication between producers and consumers, without going via intermediary nodes such as UDP multicast, ZeroMQ, webhooks,…</li>      <li>A widely-used alternative is to send messages via a message broker/message queue. Two types of them are:        <ul>          <li>AMQP/JMS-style message brokers: the broker assigned individual messages to consumers, consumers acknowledge when they have been successfully processed.</li>          <li>Log-based message brokers: the broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers messages in the same order while consumers keep their logs.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>When multiple consumers are reading messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are load balancing and fan out.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>It’s also useful to think of the writes to a database as a stream that it can capture the changelog, either implicitly through change data capture or explicitly through event sourcing as it also opens up powerful opportunities for integrating systems.    <ul>      <li>You can keep derived data systems such as search indexes, caches and analytics systems continually up-to-date by consuming the log of changes and applying them to the derived system.</li>      <li>You can even build fresh views onto existing data by starting from scratch and consuming the log of changes from the beginning all the way to the present.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Stream processing has long been used for monitoring purposes, where an organization wants to be alerted if certain things happen. However, other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time.    <ul>      <li>Complex event processing (CEP) allows you to specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in a stream.</li>      <li>Analytics that are more oriented towards aggregations and statistical metrics over a large number of events are also used.</li>      <li>It can be used to maintain materialized views onto some dataset, so that you can query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying data changes.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine to determine windowing. Even though it’s simple to implement and reason about, it breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.</li>  <li>There are 3 types of join that may appear in stream processes:    <ul>      <li>Stream-stream joins: matching two events that occur within some window of time.</li>      <li>Stream-table joins: one input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database changelog.</li>      <li>Table-table joins: both input streams are database changelogs where every change on one side is joined with the latest state of the other side.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>To tolerate faults, one solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a miniature batch process (microbatching). Other is to use idempotent writes.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID</a></li></ul>",

            "content_text": "  Taking to customer is hard.          Conversations take time and easy to screw up.      Bad conversations give you a false positive which convince you that you’re on the right path when you’re not.        You shouldn’t ask your mom or anyone whether your business is a good idea because it’s a bad question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little.  The Mom Test is a set of 3 simple rules for crating good questions that even your mom can’t lie about:          Talk about their lives instead of your idea.      Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.      Talk less and listen more.        Fix a bad question.          “Do you think it’s a good idea?”                  Only the market can tell you if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion.          Instead, ask how they currently do it, which parts they love and hate, which solutions they tried before settling in this one, are they actively seeking for replacement, why and why not,…                    “Would you buy a product which did X?”                  You’re asking overly optimistic people who want to make you happy by always answering “Yes”.          Instead, ask how they currently solve X, how much it costs to do so, how much time it takes, talk through what happened last time X came up, why and why not, are they seeking for better solutions,…                    “How much would you pay for X”                  Similar to the last one, except the number makes it feel truthy.          Instead, ask how much does the problem cost them, how much do they currently pay to solve it, how big is their budget,…                    “Would you pay X for a product which did Y?”                  As always, ask what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future.                      None of good these questions are about what you should build but customers’ problems, cares and goals. People don’t know what they want in a product, it’s your job to gather good information, come up with a solution and verify it.          “What would your dream product do?” and ask follow-up questions to try to understand why they want these features as well.      “Why do you bother?” to dig down into their goals, pain points and motivations.      “What are the implications of that?” to distinguishes between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems and thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it problem since some problems don’t matter or worth spending time with.      “Talk me through the last time that happened” to learn through their actions instead of their opinions.      “What else have you tried?”, “How are you dealing with it now?”,  what they love/hate, how much does it cost, how much would those fixes be worth, how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution.      “Where does the money come from?”, whose budget the purchase will come from, who holds the power to seal the deal.      End every conversation with “Who else should I talk to?”, “Is there anything else I should have asked?” can lead to more deals.        Avoiding 3 types of bad data.          Compliments.                  They don’t give you any meaningful data.          Try to be more specific. Why did that person like the idea, how much money would it save him, what else has he tried which failed to solve his problem,…                    Fluff: generics (“usually”, “always”, “never”), hypotheticals (“might”, “could”), and the future (“would”, “will”).                  Be more specific.          Ask when it last happened, talk through it, how they solved it, what else they tried.                    Ideas.                  Take a moment to dig into the motivations behind the idea/feature request.          Why do you want that? What would that let you do? How are you coping without it? Do you think we could push back the launch to add that feature? How would that fit into your day?          Tell me more about that. That seems to really bug you. What makes it so awful? Why haven’t you been able to fix it already? Is this a big deal? Why so happy?                      Keeping it casual.          Strip all the formality from the process.      Make it a quick and casual chat.        Commitment and advancement.          A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the next step.      Commitment can either be time, reputation risk, or finance.                  Time commitment include: having a clear next meeting with known goals, sitting down to give feedback, using a trial.          Reputation risk include: intro to peers/team or a decision maker (boss, lawyer), giving a public testimonial or case study.          Financial commitment include: letter of intent to purchase, pre-order, deposit.                    A bad meeting can be saved just pushing for a commitment at the end.                  “That’s so cool. I love it!”: deflect the compliment and get back to business.          “Looks great. Let me know when it launches.”: look for a commitment I could ask for today.          “There are a couple people I can intro you to when you’re ready.”: ask who they want to introduce you to, what “ready” means, why he can’t make the intro now,…          “I would definitely buy that.”: ask for a letter of intent/a pre-purchase/deposit/intros to other decision makers and team members,…                      If you already know your customers, go talk to them. If you don’t know, how to find these conversations?          Cold calls are hard, though having only one is enough to start the train.                  Try to keep it informal. Don’t even need to mention you have a business. Have a good conversation. Be interested in other people’s problems.                    Instead of reaching out to them, what can you offer what will make them want to talk to you?                  Organize meet-ups, give talks at conferences, host workshops, teach through videos, blogging,…                    Reach out to general audiences and ask for references. Everyone knows someone. We just need to ask.      Find advisors, including industry experts as well as professors.      Find investors.      5 key elements of a good reach-out:                  You’re trying to solve problem X. Don’t mention your idea.          Mention what stage you’re at and you don’t have anything to sell.          Mention specific problems you need their help on.          Show them how much they can help.          Ask for help.                    For example:                  “Hey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and ultimately effective.”          “We’re having a load of trouble figuring out how all the pieces of the industry fit together and where we can best fit into it (weakness). You know more about this industry than anyone and could really save us from a ton of mistakes (pedestal).”          “We’re funded and have a couple products out already, but this is in no way a sales meeting – we’re just moving into a new area and could really use some of your expertise (framing).”          “Can you spare a bit of time in the next week to help point us in the right direction over a coffee? (ask)”                      Talking to a lot of different people leads to confusing signals and overwhelming options and feedbacks that hard to make sense of. How do you choose then?          Categorize customers in different group and evaluate which group seems most profitable, easy to read and rewarding for us.        Running the process.          Before the conversation: decide 3 big learning goals, guess what they care about so that we can compare with our notes later.      During the conversation: keep it casual, ask good questions, take good notes, press for commitment and next steps.      After the conversation: review notes with team, transfer to a permanent storage that is searchable.      References:  http://momtestbook.com/",

            "content_text": "  Focus on high-leverage activities.          Leverage: impact produced / time invested.      80/20 rule: 80% impact comes from 20% work.      Focus on not more hours but more value per limited time on the task.      Increase leverage by:                  Reduce the time it takes to complete the activity (default to half-hour meeting instead of one-hour one, automate manual dev process).          Increase the value produced (have a clear agenda beforehand, prioritize tasks based on launch date).          Shift to higher-leverage activities (use email instead of in-person discussion, talk to customer).                    Output can be measured by:                  Number of projects launched          Bug fixes          Users acquired          Engineers hired          Quality          Revenue generated                      Understand the power of compound interest.          Compounding leads to an exponential growth curve.      The earlier compounding starts, the sooner it hits the exponential growth, the faster you can reap its benefits.      Small deltas in the interest rate can make massive differences in the long run:                  Improving by 1% per day makes us 37x better at the end of year.          Google idea of 20% where engineers spend about 1 day a week on a side project to make the company better results in successful products such as Gmail , Google News, Adsense,…                      Optimize for learning because learning compounds.          Find fast growing work environment.      Take advantage of the resources at your work.                  Study code from best engineers.          Write more code.          Go through technical, educational material.          Send code views to the harshest critics.          Participate in design discussions - don’t wait for invitation.          Team with senior engineers.                    Invest in other skills too.                  Invest in skills that are in high demand.          Build strong relationships.          Read books.          Write to teach.          Pursue side projects.                      Prioritize regularly.          Track TODO list in a single list.      Sort the list frequently by asking yourself on a recurring basis:                  Is there anything else I could be doing that’s higher-leverage?                          Focus on what directly produce value (products shipped, user acquired, business metrics moved, sales made).              Focus on the important and non-urgent (planning career goals, building relationships, personal development, improving workflow).                                          Preserve larger blocks of focused time + learn to say no to unimportant activities.      Limit the amount of work in progress + resist the urge to work on too many projects at once.      Make it a habit.        Iterate quickly to build more and learn faster.          Invest in time-saving tools.                  Bringing the release time down to several minutes helps the team deploy more frequently, 40-50 times a day - skyrockets growth.          If it saves you 1 hour a day, it saves 10 people 10 times as much.                    Measure the progress frequently.        Validate early and often.          A well tested, clean design, scalable product doesn’t deliver much value if users don’t engage or customers don’t buy it.      Bounce ideas off teammates.        Define measurable milestones.References:  https://www.effectiveengineer.com/book",

            "content_text": " Table of Contents   What is a good life according to Stoicism?  Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good life          Negative visualization      Trichotomy of control      Fatalism      Self-denial (extension of negative visualization)      Meditation        Advice on daily living          How to think about social duty      How to preserve tranquility while interacting with other people      How to deal with insult      How to respond to the death      How to overcome anger/anti-joy      How to think about fame      How to think about wealth/luxurious living      What is a good life according to Stoicism?Having a good life is not about making a good living or having a high-paying job since one could hate the job or have conflicting thoughts about its moral.A person must be virtuous in order to have a good life. A person’s virtue depends on their excellence as a human being, how well one performs the function for which humans were designed. For example, a virtuous hammer is one that can drive nails well, a virtuous scissors is one that can cut well. To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, that is to reason, to do certain things, to have certain duties. For example, one of which is the social duty that is to honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends,…Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good lifeNegative visualizationBad things happen, no matter how hard we try to prevent them. Assuming we will always be able to enjoy things we value causes us distress when they are taken from us.We are unhappy largely because we’re insatiable. After working hard for what we desire, we quickly get bored, dissatisfied, take things for granted and eventually chase new desire.  Consumer purchase: longing for a new TV, laptop, phone after buying one several weeks ago  Job: wanting higher pay, new workplace, new boss after landing the job of our dreams  Relationship: fantasizing about starting a new relationship after marriageThe solution is to forestall the adaptation process, even better reverse it so that we stop taking things for granted and desire what we already have.  Image that we have lost the things we value, our wife has left, our relatives and friends were death, we lost our job, our house, our money and so on.  As we go about our day, reflect periodically that we will not live forever and this day could be our last. The goal is not to change our activities but our state of mind that we carry out these activities and appreciate today.Most of us are already living the dream, having a wonderful partner, a dream job, a good car though we take things for granted other than delighting in them. Some are less fortunate, still the practice of negative still can be applied.Being satisfied with what we’ve got doesn’t mean we shouldn’t seek certain things in life or strive to become better.Trichotomy of controlThere are things over which we have:  Complete control: goals we set for ourself, opinions and values we form  No control: whether the sun will rise tomorrow  Some but not complete control: whether we will win a competition or become a millionaire though we try really hard for itWe should not concern ourselves with things that we have no control of. If we want things that we have less or no control, we will sometimes fail to get what we want, be upset and anxious about it.A strategy to deal with things that we have less or no control is to be careful about the goals and values that we form. Instead of setting a goal to win a competition, which we only have partial control, set a goal to do our best in the match, which we have complete control. We’ll free ourself from frustration or disappointment if we lose.FatalismWe must learn to welcome whatever comes to us and trust that it happens is for the best.We have no control of the past as well as the present (this very moment). That said, we’re wasting time worrying about past and present events. Instead of wishing it could be different, embrace it.Self-denial (extension of negative visualization)Besides contemplating bad things happening, we should sometimes live as if they had happened, cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could have avoided (experience cold weather even though clothes are at hand).Benefits of voluntary discomfort:  Harden ourselves against misfortune that might happen in the future.  Grow confident that we can withstand major discomfort.  Help us appreciate what we have.Besides practicing voluntary discomfort, we should sometimes forgo opportunities to experience pleasure, choose not to do things that make us feel good (eating carb and sugar).Willpower is like muscle power: the more exercise, the stronger they are; the more will power we have, the more self-control and courage we have.MeditationOn the events of daily living at bedtime:  Did something disrupt our tranquility?  Did we experience anger/envy/lust?  Is there something that I could avoid?On our Stoic progress:  Do we periodically engage in negative visualization?  Do we take time to distinguish between these things over which we have control, less and no control?  Are we careful to initialize our goals?  Have we refrained from dwelling on the past and instead focused our attention on the future?  Have we consciously practiced acts of self-denial?Advice on daily livingHow to think about social dutyWe were designed to live among other people and interact with them in a manner that is advantageous. To fulfill this social duty, we must feel a concern for all humankind, to do good and bear with them.How to preserve tranquility while interacting with other peopleWe can’t be selective in doing our social duty (dealing with annoying, misguided people) though we can be selective about whom we befriend, ones that share our values. When dealing with annoying people, keep in mind that there are people that find us annoying as well so that we can also reflect on our shortcomings and become more empathetic to others’ faults. Due to fatalism, we should operate on the assumption that annoying people are fated to behave that way and it’s expectable (though they can be changed of course). The risk in dealing with annoying people is that they will make us hate them, though that only makes us more like them. The best revenge is to refuse to do so.How to deal with insultWhat upsets us is not things themselves but our judgments about these things.When insulted, pause and consider if what the insulter said is true, how well-inform the insulter is, or if we respect him.  If it’s true or we respect the insulter, we should reflect on ourselves and strive to be better.  If not, we should feel relived because it’s the right thing to do as we don’t need their approval. For example, if a dog barks us, we don’t be upset by the fact that he might dislike us.One of the best way to respond to insult is with humor, especially self-deprecating jokes. Another way is with no response. By not responding to the insulter, we are robbing him the pleasure of having upset us which is likely to make him upset as a result. Also, no one wants to be ignored and the insulter is likely to feel humiliated then.How to respond to the deathIt’s not possible to eliminate grief but possible to minimize the amount of grief we experience in our life. One strategy that is mentioned above is negative visualization. Also, remember that the person whose death that we’re grieving wouldn’t want us to be tortured with tears.How to overcome anger/anti-joyWe should fight our tendency to believe the worst about other and our tendency to jump to conclusion about their motivations. Things that anger us generally don’t do us any real harm. Sometimes things that we think are important are actually are not that important.Humor can help if we choose to think that bad things happening to us is funny and amusing.When angry, force ourselves to relax our face, soften our voice, slow our pace of walking and so on.How to think about fameIf we seek social status, we give other people power over us in a sense that we have to do things that make them admire us. In other words, we will have enslaved ourselves. That said, we should be confident about ourselves and our values and ignore what people think of us.How to think about wealth/luxurious livingThere’s a danger that if we’re exposed to a luxurious lifestyle, we will lose our ability to take delight in simple things.  We become harder to please.  Our standards are constantly getting higher as we want nothing but the best.  Once it starts, it’s difficult to stop.Luxurious lifestyle is harder to maintain and keep up with.People who achieve luxurious lifestyle are rarely satisfied or happy since they will only learn that they crave even more luxury.Even though a Stoic doesn’t pursue wealth, they nevertheless acquire it. It’s acceptable for them to enjoy wealth, as long as they are careful not to cling to it. Also, by the practice of negative visualization, they should be prepared as their wealth can be taken away from them anytime.References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life",

A person’s virtue depends on their excellence as a human being, how well one performs the function for which humans were designed. For example, a virtuous hammer is one that can drive nails well, a virtuous scissors is one that can cut well. To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, that is to reason, to do certain things, to have certain duties. For example, one of which is the social duty that is to honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends,…</p><h2 id=\"psychological-techniques-to-practice-stoicism-for-attaining-a-good-life\">Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good life</h2><h3 id=\"negative-visualization\">Negative visualization</h3><p>Bad things happen, no matter how hard we try to prevent them. Assuming we will always be able to enjoy things we value causes us distress when they are taken from us.</p><p>We are unhappy largely because we’re insatiable. After working hard for what we desire, we quickly get bored, dissatisfied, take things for granted and eventually chase new desire.</p><ul>  <li>Consumer purchase: longing for a new TV, laptop, phone after buying one several weeks ago</li>  <li>Job: wanting higher pay, new workplace, new boss after landing the job of our dreams</li>  <li>Relationship: fantasizing about starting a new relationship after marriage</li></ul><p>The solution is to forestall the adaptation process, even better reverse it so that we stop taking things for granted and desire what we already have.</p><ul>  <li>Image that we have lost the things we value, our wife has left, our relatives and friends were death, we lost our job, our house, our money and so on.</li>  <li>As we go about our day, reflect periodically that we will not live forever and this day could be our last. The goal is not to change our activities but our state of mind that we carry out these activities and appreciate today.</li></ul><p>Most of us are already living the dream, having a wonderful partner, a dream job, a good car though we take things for granted other than delighting in them.

If we want things that we have less or no control, we will sometimes fail to get what we want, be upset and anxious about it.</p><p>A strategy to deal with things that we have less or no control is to be careful about the goals and values that we form. Instead of setting a goal to win a competition, which we only have partial control, set a goal to do our best in the match, which we have complete control. We’ll free ourself from frustration or disappointment if we lose.</p><h3 id=\"fatalism\">Fatalism</h3><p>We must learn to welcome whatever comes to us and trust that it happens is for the best.</p><p>We have no control of the past as well as the present (this very moment).

            "content_text": "  Concentrate:          Do one thing at a time.                  Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration.                    Have a clear purpose on what you want to learn about.                  What does it matter?          How is it applicable to my life? How can I apply it?          How can it help me achieve my goals?                      Create and connect:          People that learn quickly or have a so-called photographic memory apply their creativity to everything they learn, using the SEE principles.                  S-Senses: the more senses you engage, the more lively the images become, the more memorable they are          E-Exaggeration: exaggerate with humor, make the images illogical, make the learning more fun and easy to memorize          E-Energize: give images action, make a movie, like how Disney does with their objects                    A tip to remember abstract concepts or complex words is to rhyme or break it own to more meaningful concepts. For examples:                  Tiger in Spanish is Tigre, which sounds like tea grey: imagine a tiger drinking grey tea          The capital of Greece is Athens, which sounds like eight hens: imagine them swimming in Greece                    Long-term memory can be used to trap short-term information.                  The car method: use your car image (long-term) and store new information on parts of the car (short-term)          The body method: use parts of your body to store new information          The peg method: use rhyming words to store ordered lists (one-bu, two-shoe, three-tree, four-door, five-hive, six-stick, seven-heaven, eight-gate, nine-vine, ten-hen)                    Linking thoughts, associating concepts, developing a story line are great ways to create a relationship between the known and unknown and strengthen the memory capacity.                  Recall, reinforce, compare different features of what you have already known to what you don’t know                      Continuous use:          Have self-discipline to stick the practice/review sessions.                  Again, have a strong vision and a clear purpose on what you want.          Make it part of your DAILY routine.          Stop listening to your feelings, just do it whether you feel like it or not.                    References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20958539-unlimited-memory",

            "content_text": "  Fragile things are exposed to volatility, robust things resist it, antifragile things benefit from it.  The antifragile system is made up of fragile parts.          The weak one dies in the process while the strong one stays.      Individual failure can provide helpful information to strengthen the system as a whole.        Shock and stressors strengthen antifragile system by forcing them to build up capacity.          When human bounce back after traumatic accidents, hardships or failures, they become stronger.      Lifting heavy puts the body to unusual stress and makes the muscle stronger.      Even though The Titanic was a disaster, it made the ship cruising system stronger.        Trying to over-control systems often leads to fragility.          Mom who overprotects her children prevents them from developing the ability to bounce back and adapt to future difficulties.        To take advantage of antifragility, you don’t need to understand the opportunities you see, just when to seize them.          Society put too much value on theoretical or academic knowledge and not too much on a practical one.      Often the most successful traders don’t know complicated economic theory or finance; they know when to buy and sell.      The Industrial Revolution was not instigated by academics but hobbyists.        The shorter the time frame you observe an event, the higher the noise you will perceive.  Prediction in the modern world is impossible.          We always find patterns, causes, explanations in past events, but they are useless for predicting the future.      An assumption that the worst event we have witnessed must be the worst that could ever happen is simply false.      What’s most likely to stick in the future is what has already been around for long.      Instead of trying to predict what is going to happen, position yourself in such a way that you have optionality.                  The more options you have, the more ways you have to respond to unforeseen events (but not too many options).          Prepare for failure scenarios.                      Squeeze is a situation where you have no choice but to do it, regardless of the cost.          They are the opposite of options.      The larger something is, the harder the squeeze, the more damage it causes.      Still, the larger something is, the harder it will be hit by unexpected events.        The Barbell Strategy suggests to play it safe on one side so that you can take more risks on other side.          Cover your downside to protect yourself from extreme harm.      Let the upside take care of itself.                  If the risky part plays out badly, you’re still fine.          If a Black Swan event makes the risks pay off big, you profit handsomely.                      Practical activities:          Lift heavy weights or do HIIT.      Practice intermittent fasting.      Eat fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, pickles,…      Cold/heat exposure.                  Take cold showers, ice baths, wear less clothes and sleep only with your sheets.          Take saunas, do Bikram yoga and get a sweat on during training.                    Put most of your money in safe investments and 10% in highly lucrative ones.      Keep your day job but take massive action on your side hustle at night.      References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile  http://siimland.com/become-antifragile/",

It’s easy to work from home or collaborate with others across the globe.          Stuff that was impossible is simple today.                    Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can’t control.                  Plans are guesses.          Don’t be obsess you it. It’s OK to wing.          Figure out what’s the next most important thing and do it.                    Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. As long as it’s sustainable and profitable, you should be proud.      Working more doesn’t mean you get more done.        Go.          If you’re going to do something, do something that matters.                  To do great work, you need to feel you’re making a different, putting a meaningful dent in the universe, that you’re part of something important. You don’t have to cure cancer. You want your customer say it makes their lives better.          You should feel an urgency too as you don’t live forever. Don’t wait for someone to make the changes you want to see.                    The easiest way to create a product/service is to make something you want to use.                  Solve your own problem first as you know what you need the most.                    Having the idea has nothing to do with actually making it.                  Start creating.          Ideas are cheap, how you execute them are what matters.                    Perfect time never comes as you’re always too busy doing something else. Do it now.      Always know why you’re doing what you’re doing. Stand for something and be proud of it.      Avoid outside funding as much as you can.                  Service businesses don’t require much capital to bootstrap anyway.          Taking people money means you have less control of your business and more human problem.          You need less than you think. Stay lean. Be frugal.                    Think about profit from day one.      Think about commitment strategy (how to grow and succeed), not exit strategy. Focus on getting customers to love you, not about worrying who’s going to buy you.        Progress.          Focus on the core product itself, ignore the details early on.      Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Do it and reflect.      Stick to the essential. Cut out unnecessary details, simplify, sort out what truly matters.      Once your product does what it needs to do at the minimum, get it out there.        Productivity.          Start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction.      Ensure that you’re doing work that matters?                  Why are you doing this?          What is the problem, exactly?          Is it actually useful?          Is it adding value at all?          Is there an easier way?          What could you be doing instead?          Is this really worth it?                    Interruption is the enemy of productivity.      Avoid meetings as they’re unproductive most of the time. Only meet when:                  Have a set time.          Invite as few people as possible.          Have a clear agenda.          Begin with a specific problem.          End with a solution and implementation plan.                    When good enough gets the job done, go for it. You can usually turn good enough to great later.      Build momentum by accomplishing small wins regularly.      Have enough sleep everyday.      Break your time frames into smaller chunks and estimate accordingly.      Use a small todo list.        Competitors.          Don’t copy competitors since you don’t know their why. Instead, believe your way.      Instead of trying to win a competitor, focus on quality (really good basic features) instead of quantities (more features).      Don’t spend too much time worrying about competitors. Focus on improving yourself instead.        Evolution.          Learn to say no.      Ask for feedbacks and ideas with enthusiasm but always evaluate the priority with a calm mind.        Promotion.          When it’s early, it’s easier to take risks without worrying about embarrassing yourself.      Build an audience.                  Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos, and so on.          Share valuable information and slowly grow your fan.          Get people interested in what you have to say.                    Teaching/sharing educational content is one of the best marketing tactics.      Be genuine. Be transparent.      Have personal, meaningful press releases instead of vague and generic ones.      As long you have something to sell, don’t be afraid to give things away for free.        Hiring.          Do it yourself first to understand what it takes.      Hire when you can’t do it no more.      Pass on hiring people you don’t need.      Hire slowly.      How long someone’s been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well.      Hire the best talent, regardless where it is.      Best way to test-drive applicants is to see them work. Hire for a mini project and go from there.

            "content_text": "  Find happiness in your career:          Motivation theory - hygiene factors vs motivation factors:                  Hygiene factors are status, compensation, job security, work condition, company policies,…                          Bad hygiene causes dissatisfaction - low salary, poor condition,…              Improving the hygience factors of your job won’t make you love it, instead just stop you from hating it.                                Motivation factors are challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth.                          Motivation is less about the external stimulation but more about what’s inside of you and your work.              It’s a job that truly meaningful to you, is challenging and intersting, allows you to grow professionally, provides you good oppoturnities,…                                One of the easiest mistake is to focus on over-satisfy the hygiene factors over the motivation factors.                          Better salaries, more prestigious title, nicer office are not gonna make you happy.              That said, ask yourself frequently:                                  Is this work meaningful to me?                  Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?                  Am I going to learn new things?                  Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?                  Am I going to be given responsibility?                                                                        How to find a career that both motivates you and satisfies the hygiene factors?                  Before taking a job, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy.                          Is this something that you enjoy doing?              What evidence do you have?                                Find ways to to test these assumptions.                    How to make sure you’re heading in the right decision on a daily basis?                  Look at how you manage your resources - time, energy, talent, wealth.          Prioritize on things that require long-term investment (building a good relationship with your family, building a business, raising a child,…)                          It’s often sad to see the same patterns happening over again in the personal lives of many ambituos people - though they believe that family is important, they actually allocate few resources for them.                                            Find happiness in your relationships:          Relationships with family and close friends are one the greatest sources of happiness in life.      It needs CONSISTENT attention and care, though it’s difficult because.                  You’ll be routinely tempted to invest your resources elsewhere that provide you a more immediate payoff.          Your family and friends rarely shout the loudest to demand your attention.                    The clock of building a fulfilling relationship is ticking from the start.      Understand what’s the most important to the other person by asking yourself “What job does one most need me to do?”.      Children need to do more than learning new skills.                  Allow them to be challenged, let them solve hard problems independently and develop values themselves.          Don’t afraid to let them fail.                      Live a life of integrity (or stay out of jail):          Integrity requires constant self-awareness.      The best way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions is to never start making one in the first place.

            "content_text": "  The starting line:          Build less: less features, options, people, meetings, promises.      Solve your problem.                  You know what’s is important and what’s not for the product itself.          It’s likely people have the same problem so now you have a market too.                    Fund yourself                  Outside funding is plan B.          Investors want their money back quickly → overhead + other complicated things follow.          Money constraints force you to focus + allow creativity.                    Fix time and budget, flex scope: better to launch great thing, on time, on a budget in small scope than big ones with many holes.      Pick up an enemy and use it as an motivation to tell better story.      If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong.        Stay lean.          Simplify + focus.      Lower the cost of change → change faster (huge advantage over big company).      Start with 3 people: a developer, a designer, and a sweeper who can roam between both world.      Work with your limited resources. Forget about VC, long release cycles, quick hires,…      Stay small and friendly → get closer to customer.        Priorities.          What is the app vision? Why does it exit? What makes it different?      Don’t get too deep in the details early one. Ship it first and optimize it later.      Don’t waste time on problems you don’t have yet:                  Scaling to millions of users? Stop dreaming! Majority of apps are never going to reach that phase. Worry about it later once it’s wildly successful.          Make decisions in time.                    Find the right audience.                  Narrow the market.          Focus on the nice or small group of people who wants the product the most.          Don’t try to please everyone.                    Make opinionated software, choose side, like every great companies (Apple, Google, Nitendo).        Feature selection.          What is the heart of the app?                  Forget milestone, TODO lists.          Just focus on the essential.          Let it gain traction. Then add to that foundation.                    Focus on what matters, REALLY. Cut off everything else.      Learn to say no because you have to do that a lot.      For every new feature, you need to:                  Say no.          Force the feature to provide its value.          If no, end. If yes, continue.          Sketch the UI.          Design the UI.          Code.          Test, tweak, repeat.          Document.          Market.          Revisit pricing options, term of service.          Launch.                    Build something that you can manage, organizationally, strategically, financially.      Don’t worry too much about feature requests. Customers will constantly remind you about that.      Ask customer what they don’t want too and simplify it if possible.        Process.          Get something real up and running quickly: it’s OK to do less, skip details, take shortcuts.                  Fail fast and learn.          Avoid unproductive scheduling and action faking (doing bullshit works that feel “productive” that doesn’t get you closer to launching).                    Idea-to-implementation cycle.                  What does the app need to do? What exactly are you going to make?          Sketch it out on paper.          Create mock-up html screens.          Code.                    Allowing options/preferences for customers is not necessarily helping them.                  If you make a bad call, they will complain, then you can fix it.                    Execute. Build momentum. Move on.      Test in the wild.                  Get it out there. Get real results + feedback.          Instead of having a beta version and a release version, have beta features in side the release one so you can have real data + workflow.          Break it down into smaller problems and solve it one by one.                      Organization.          Build a healthy organization.      Utilize your alone time to get work done.      Meetings are normally unproductive.      Have fewer meetings.      Only have it with a clear agenda.      Release something today. Celebrate small victories.        Staffing.          Hire less, only when it’s really needed.      Working with prospective employees on a real project can give a lot of insights. However, not everyone has time for that.      Look at people codes + contribution on open-source projects.      Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists.      Go for happy one.      Hire good writers because they know how to communicate.        Interface.          Design the interface before you start coding.      Start from the core page and build outward. Focus on what matters.      For each page, consider these 3 states:                  Blank: the screen before data is entered (could insert quick tutorials, help blurbs, examples with mock data,…)          Regular: normal page          Error: when shit happens                    It’s OK to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way      Every letter matters.                  Don’t sound like an engineer talking to another engineer.          Keep it short and sweet.                    Incorporate admin function into public interfaces so you don’t need to manage 2 different versions.        Code.          Keep it simple. But be mindful about technical debt.      Less maintenance and support work.      Low cost of change.      Fewer bugs.      Choose the tools that everyone is happy and productive with.      Get data into the world via RSS, API,…        Words.          Document what is needed but nothing else.      Write stories, not details.                  Don’t get into the technical/design details, just a quick story.          Treat it as a normal conversation.                    Use real data if possible, not dummy text all the time → focus on the UX.      What is your product’s personality type?        Pricing and signup          Give something for free. Let  people experience and see its usefulness.      Make signup and cancellation easy.      Avoid long term contract, signup fee,…        Promotion.          Teaser (dropping hints), preview, launch.      Build a promo site: overview, tour, screenshots, videos, manifesto, case studies, buzz (customers, press reviews,…), forum, pricing and signup, blog,…      Blogging can be more effective (and cheaper) than advertising. Could write about advices, tips, tricks, links,…      Start collecting emails asap.      Share your knowledge. Teaching/educating is a great way to market yourself and your product too.                  Blog (as above).          Speak at conferences.          Conduct workshops.          Give interviews.          Write articles/books                    Track your online present. Leave comments, thank you notes, response to negative ones thoughtfully.      Promote upgrade, in-app purchases.      Pick an short, catchy, memorable name.        Support.          Feel the pain yourself. Don’t outsource. Learn from it.      Use inline help and FAQ instead of giving manual training.      Just response quickly even if you don’t have a perfect answer (during business hour).      Also thank them for their input.      Be willing to say no.      Use forum or chat to let customers help each other.      Be open, honest, transparent (yeah bad news).        Post launch.          Issue a major update 30 days after launch.      Don’t stop blogging: new FAQs, tutorials, news, features, updates, fixes, buzz/press.      Prioritize your bugs.      Wait before the storm, 1-2 days after releasing a new feature and hearing complaints, then take action.      Know your competitors.      More mature doesn’t mean more complicated, as long as you provide valuable services that’s fine.      Be open to new paths and changes in direction .

            "content_text": "  Happiness (H) = S (Biological happiness set point) + C (Life conditions) + V (Voluntary activities).          Each person has a characteristic level of happiness that each is born with.      It’s not a set point but a range.      The challenge is to understand C and V in order to push H to the top of the range.        The 2 biggest parts of C are love and pursuing the right goals.          We are social creatures in a sense that we can’t be happy without having friends and secure attachments. To love well is to have good relationships with other people.      The right goals are ones that produce states of flow and engagement.      Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness.                  According to the adaptation principle, we’re likely to adapt to what we set for ourselves. Luxuries and other goods adapt completely while some other “purchases” are less subject to:                          Spending more time with friends and family.              Reducing commuting time even if it means living in smaller houses.              Taking longer vacations even if it means earning less.              Programming Ruby, building Basecamp, writing for Signal v Noise, taking pictures, and enjoying all the same avenues of learning and entertainment my already privileged lifestyle had afforded me for years in advance.                                            V are things that we choose to do, not that we have to, such as meditation, exercise, learning new things and so on.          We can increase our happiness if we use your strengths, particularly in the service of strengthening connections such as helping friends, expressing gratitude to benefactors.      According to the progress principle, pleasure comes more from making progress toward a goal than from achieving them. That said, we should take the initiative and perform gratifying activities regularly.

            "content_text": "  How testosterone is made:          Sub-types of testosterone:                  Free: purest form with no protein attached, has the most benefits though only makes up 2-3% of our total testosterone          SHBG-bound: help regulating the amount of free testosterone, biologically inactive (our bodies can’t use this type of testosterone to help build muscles or boost our mood), makes up 40-50% of our total testosterone          Albumin-bound: stabilize extra-cellular fluid volumes, also biologically inactive though can be easily broken in order to create free testosterone when needed                    A small percentage of testosterone is made in the adrenal glands on top of our kidneys, but 95% of it is made in our testicles.        Testosterone deficiency downsides:          Men suffering from depression typically have low T level.      As the T level decreases, the body’s ability to regulate insulin decreases, causes fat to accumulate, put one at higher risk for type 2 diabetes.      Low libido and erectile dysfunction are two of the first signs of low testosterone.      Low testosterone levels to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease as well as the cognitive ability issues (memory loss, trouble concentrating, fogginess).        The keys to increasing testosterone level naturally are eating better, exercising smarter, and getting more sleep.          Eat more high-fat foods.                  Higher fat and cholesterol consumption results in increased levels of total T.          High protein and low carb could cause the T level to decrease.          Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage remove estrogens that lower our T.          Author’s diet (40% carb, 30% protein, 30% fats):                          Breakfast: three slices of bacon and three whole eggs              Lunch: salad mix: meat (the fattier the better), Brazil nuts/walnuts, avocados/olives, spinach, broccoli              Dinner: whatever though try to get as much as carb from veggie and fruit                                          If you want to take supplements, consider vitamin D3 and omega3 fish oil, though they only help a bit.      Exercise regularly.                  Strength training: Starting Strength, 5/3/1 program.          HIIT training.          Don’t overtrain (3-4 times a week is good), move more instead.                    Get better sleep.                  If you don’t have “morning wood” on a consistent basis, you might have low T.          If you’re not getting enough quality sleep, your body can’t produce testosterone as efficiently or effectively.          Try to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep consistently.                    Manage stress.                  Go for long walk.          Practice deep breathing exercise.                    Avoid xenoestrogens chemicals by using organic products.      Have more sex.      Take cold bath.
