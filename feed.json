            "content_text": "I. 4 fundamental ideas that we need in order to design data-intensive applications.  Reliable, scalable, maintainable applications.          Reliability means continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong. Common faults and preventions include:                  Hardware faults: hard disks crash, blackout, incorrect network configuration,…                          Add redundancy to individual hardware components to reduce the failure rate.              As long as we can restore a backup onto a new machine quickly, the downtime is not fatal.                                Software faults: bug, out of shared resources, unresponsive service, cascading failure,…                          There’s no quick solution other than thorough testing, measuring, monitoring, analyzing.                                Human errors: design error, configuration error,…                          Enforce good design, good practice and training.              Decouple the places where people make the most mistake.              Automate testing: unit test, integration test, end-to-end test.              Allow quick recovery rollback strategy.              Set up details monitoring                                          Scalability describes a system’s ability to cope with increased load.                  Describing load: requests per second, read/write radio, active users, cache hit rate,…          Describing performance:                          When you increase a load parameter, keep system resources unchanged, how is performance affected?              When you increase a load parameter, how much do you increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?                                Approaches for coping with load:                          Scaling up (vertical scaling): move to a more powerful machine.              Scaling out (horizontal scaling): distribute the load across different machines.                                          Maintainability focuses on 3 design principles:                  Operability: make it easy for operation teams to keep the system running smoothly.                          Provide monitoring system health.              Support for automation and integration tools.              Have Good documentation.                                Simplicity: make it easy for new engineers to understand the system.                          Provide good abstraction layers that allow us to extract parts of a large system into well-defined, reusable components.                                Evolvability: make it easy for engineers to make changes.                          Follow agile approach.                                            Data models and query languages.          Data started out being represented as one big tree, though it wasn’t good for representing many-to-many relationships models, so the relational model was invented.      However, some applications didn’t fit well into the relational model, non-relational NoSQL was born:                  Document database: self-contained documents, rare relationships between one model and another.          Graph database: anything is related to everything.                      Storage and retrieval.          Data structres that power your database:                  Hash indexes:                          Basically key-value pairs where each key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file.              Can also split it into smaller chunks/segments for easy storing.              Even though it’s easy to understand and implement, it has memory constrains that the hash table must fit in memory. Also range queries are not efficient since hashed keys are not put next to each other.                                Sorted String Table (SSTable) and Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-trees):                          SSTable maintains a list of key-value pairs that is sorted by key.              The table can also be split into smaller segments and merging is simple as it is sorted.              Maintaining a sorted structure on disk is possible, though keeping it in memory is easy as we can use a tree data structure such as Red-Black trees or AVL trees (memtable).              If the database crashes, memtable might be lost though we can keep a separate log for it, inspired by LSM-tree indexing structure.                                B-trees:                          Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups and range queries.              Instead of breaking down the database into variable-size segments and always writing sequentially, B-trees break into fixed-size blocks/pages and reading/writing one page at a time.              Every modification is first written to a write-ahead log (WAL) so that the index can be restored to a consistent state after a crash.                                          Transactional processing or analytic?                  The basic database access pattern is similar to processing business transaction (create, read, update, delete record), as known as online transaction processing (OLTP).          Since OLTP are expected to be highly available as they’re critical to the operation of the business, they’re reluctant to let business analysts run ad-hoc analytic queries.          A data warehouse is a separate database that analysts can query without affecting OLTP operations.                          Data is extracted from OLTP databases, transformed into an analysis-friendly schema, cleaned up, and then loaded into the data warehouse.              A big advantage of using a separate data warehouse is that the data warehouse can be optimized for analytic access patterns.              2 popular schemas that data are stored in are star schema, snowflake schema.                                          Column-oriented storage:                  In most OLTP databases, storage is laid out in a row-oriented fashion: all the values from one row of a table are stored next to each other. In the column-oriented storage, all the values are stored from each column together instead.          Since the sequences of values for each column are often look repetitive (distinct values are small), they often lend themselves well to compression.                    Aggregation:                  Since data warehouse queries often involve an aggregate function, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN or MAX, we can cache these aggregated values that are used often.          One way of creating such a cache is a materialized view, while data cube is a special case.                      Encoding and evolution.          Formats for encoding data.                  Many languages come with built-in support for encoding in-memory objects to byte sequences though they are not used because it’s language-specific and don’t show good performance.          JSON, XML are widely known, supported due to the fact that they are simple, can be used by many languages and have built-in support for web browser. However, there are a lot of ambiguity around the encoding of numbers and they also don’t support binary encoding (compact, efficient encoding). Hence the development of MessagePack, BSON, BJSON, and so on.          Thrift and Protocol Buffers are binary encoding libraries that require a schema for any data that is encoded, that is clearly defined forward and backward compatibility semantics. They come with a code generation tool that produces classes that implement the schema in various programming languages.          There’s is also a binary encoding library Avro that is good for processing large files as in Hadoop’s use cases.                    Modes of data flow (from one process to anther).                  Databases: the process writing to the database encodes the data, and the process reading from the database decodes it.          Calls to services, REST and RPC (gRPC): client encodes a request, server decodes the request and encodes a response, and client finally decodes the response.          Asynchronous message-passing (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka): nodes send each other messages that are encoded by the sender and decoded by the recipient.                    II. Replication, partitioning/sharding, transactions, and what it means to achieve consistency and consensus in a distributed system.  Replication.          Why would you want to replicate data?                  Reduce latency by keeping data geographically close to users.          Increase availability.          Increase throughput.                    2 types of algorithms are leader-based replication and leaderless replication.      Leader-based replication:                  Workflow:                          One of the replicas is designed as the leader while others are followers.              Client must send write request to the leader though can send read request to both leader and followers.              After the leader writes data to its local storage, it sends the changes to all of its followers so that they can self apply accordingly.                                An important detail of a replicated system is whether the replication happens synchronously or asynchronously.                          Even though the advantage of synchronous replication is that followers is that the follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date data, if the synchronous follower doesn’t respond, the write cannot be processed, thus the leader must block all writes and wait until one is available again.              It is impractical for all followers to be synchronous so leader-based replication is often configured to be completely asynchronous.                                From time to time, you need to set up new followers to increase the number of replicas, or to replace failed nodes. This can usually be done without downtime by maintaining a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database.          If the follower goes down, it can recover quite easily from its logs that it has received from the leader. Later when it’s able to talk to the leader again, it can request all the missing data and catch up to the leader.          If the leader goes down, a possible approach is failover: one of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader using a consensus algorithm, clients and followers need to be configured to talk to the new leader. However, failover can go wrong as well (two leaders, choosing the right timeout before the leader is declared dead,…) as there are no easy solutions to these.          Different implementation of replication logs:                          Statement-based replication: the leader logs every write request that it executes, and sends that statement log to its followers. Even though it seems reasonable, non-deterministic function, such as NOW() to get current date and time, is likely to generate a different value on each replica.              Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping: similar to B-tree’s approach where every modification is first written to a WAL, besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it to its followers so that they can build a copy of the exact same data structures as found on the leader.              Logical log replication: allow the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine by using different log formats.              Trigger-based replication: register a trigger to only replicate subset of the data, or from one kind of database to another and so on.                                Replication lags:                          If the user view the data shortly after making the write, new data may have not yet reach the replica. In this case, we need read-after-write consistency, meaning we can read from the leader first, so that user always see their latest changes.              If a user makes several reads from different replicas and there’s lagging among replicas, they might not see the correct data. Monotonic reads guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen by making sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica.              If some followers are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the answer before they see the question. Preventing this kind of anomaly requires consistent prefix reads so that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.                                          Multi-leader replication:                  Use cases:                          Multi-datacenter operation: each datacenter has its own leader. This can improve perfomance, tolerance of datacenter outages though same data may be concurrently modified in two different datacenters, and those write conflicts must be resolved.              Client with offline operation: every client has a local database that acts as a leader, and there is an asynchronous multi-leader replication process (sync) between the replicas on all of your clients.              Real-time collaborative editing: when one user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other users who are editing the same document.                                Handling write conflicts:                          A write conflict can be caused by two leaders concurrently updating the same record. In a single-leader scenario, it can’t happen since the second leader will wait for the first write or abort it. In a multi-leader one, both writes are successful and the conflict can only be detected asynchronously at later point in time.              The simplest way for dealing with multi-leader write conflicts is to avoid them by making sure all writes go through the same designated leader.              Since there is no defined ordering of writes in a multi-leader database, it’s unclear what the final value should be in all replicas. A number of ways to converge to the final value include giving each writes a unique ID and picking one with the highest ID as the winner, somehow merging values together,…                                Topologies: communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another.                          The most general topology is all-to-all where every leader sends its writes to every other leader. Other popular ones are circular and star topology.              A problem with circular and star topologies is that if one node fails, the path is broken, resulting in some nodes are not connected others.              Even though all-to-all topologies avoid a single point of failure, they can also have issues that some replications are faster and can overtake others. A technique called version vectors can be used to order these events correctly.                                          Leaderless replication: client writes to several replicas or a coordinator node does this on behalf of the client.                  A failover does not exist in a leaderless replication. If a node is down, client writes to all available replicas in parallel, verify if they’re successful and simply ignore the one unavailable replica. Read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel to avoid stale values.          To ensure all up-to-date data is copied to every replica, two often used mechanisms are read repair (make requests to several nodes in parallel and detect stale values using versioning), anti-entropy process (background process that constantly looks for differences in the data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to another).          If there are n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least r nodes for each read, as long as w + r &gt; n, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading, because at least one of the r nodes we’re reading from must be up-to-date. However, there’re still edge cases when stale values are return:                          Using a sloppy quorum.              Two writes happen concurrently, or with read.              A node carrying a failed value.                                For multi-datacenter operation, some implementation of leaderless replication keeps all communication between clients and database nodes local to one datacenter, so n describes the number of replicas within one datacenter. Cross-datacenter replication works similarly to multi-leader replication.          Handling concurrent write conflicts:                          Last write wins: attach a timestamp to each write, pick the biggest timestamp as the most ‘recent’, and discard any writes with a lower timestamp.              Version vectors:                                  For a singple replica, the algorithm works as follow:                                          A server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written.                      A client must read a key before writing. When a client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read.                      When the server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below but it must keep all values with a higher version number.                                                        For multiple replicas:                                          We need to use a version number per replica as well as per key.                      Each replica increments its own version number when processing a write, and also keeps track of the version numbers it has seen from all of the other replicas.                                                                                                                Partitioning/sharding.          The main reason for partitioning is scalability: partitions can be distributed across many nodes, disks, and so on.      It is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partitions are stored on multiple nodes.      The goal of partitioning is to spread the data and query load evenly across nodes.      Partitioning of key-value data.                  One way of partitioning is to assign a continuous range of keys to each partition. However, the downside is that certain patterns can lead to high load.          Another way is to use a hash function to determine the partition for a given key. A downside is the ability to efficiently do range queries as adjacent keys are now scattered across all partitions.                    Partitioning and secondary indexes.                  Partitioning becomes more complicated if secondary indexes are involved since they don’t identify records uniquely but rather, it’s a way of searching for occurrences of a particular value.          Two main approaches are document-based partitioning and term-based partitioning.          With document-based partitioning, each partition maintains its own secondary indexes covering only the documents in that partition. Since it doesn’t care about other partitions, reading from it can be quite expensive since one need to query all partitions and aggregate everything for more exact results.          With term-based partitioning, rather than each partition having its own secondary index, we can construct a global index that covers data in all partitions. This can make reads more efficient rather than doing scatter/gather over all partitions. The downside is that writes are now slower and more complicated, because a write to a single document may now affect multiple partitions of the index.                    Rebalancing partitions as we increase our nodes and machines over time.                  Mod N approach is problematic when the number of nodes N changes, most of the keys need to be moved as well.          A simple solution is to create many more partitions than there are nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. If a new node is added, it can steal a few partitions from every existing node.          Rebalancing can be done automatically, though it won’t hurt to have a human in the loop to help prevent operational surprises.                    Request routing/service discovery.                  After the partitioning and rebalancing, how does the client know which node to connection to?                          Client can talk to any node and forward the request to the appropriate node if needed.              Client can talk to a routing tier that determines the node that should handle the request and forwards it accordingly.                                            Transactions.          Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID).                  Since transactions are often composed of multiple statements, atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single “unit”, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.          Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.          Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other.          Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.                    Weak isolation levels.                  Database hides concurrency issues from application developers by providing transaction isolation, especially serializable isolation, by guaranteeing that have transactions the same effect as if they ran serially, one at a time without any concurrency.          In practice, serializable isolation has a performance cost and many databases don’t want to pay that price. Instead, they use weaker levels of isolation.          Read committed.                          When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed.              When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed.                                Snapshot isolation or Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC).                          Each transaction read from a consistent snapshot of the database. Each transaction sees the latest data from the time it starts.                                Preventing lost update.                          Lost update can occur if two transations modify the value concurrently that one modification is lost.              2 popular approaches are to use atomic write and locking.                                Preventing write skew and phantoms.                          Write skew is a generalization of lost update. It happens when two transaction update some of the same objects, not just the same object.              Phantom happens while a write in one transaction change the result of a search query in another transaction.              Since multiple objects are involved, atomic single-object or snapshot isolation write doesn’t help as it doesn’t prevent valid conflicting concurrent writes.              A simple and straightforward solution is to use serializable isolation.                                          Implementation of serializable isolation.                  Actual serial execution.                          The best way to avoid concurrency issue is to execute only one transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread.              The entire transaction is submitted as a stored procedure as the data must be small and fast.                                Two-phase locking (2PL).                          2PL has really strong requirements where writers don’t just block writers, readers also block writers and vice versa.              The big downside is performance as it hasn’t used a lot in practice.                                Serializable snapshot isolation (SSI).                          As serial isolation doesn’t scale well and 2PL doesn’t perform well, SSI is promising since it provides full serializability and has only a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation.              It allows transactions to proceed without blocking. When a transaction wants to commit, it is checked, and aborted if the execution was not serializable.                                            Things that may go wrong in a distributed system.          A partial failure is when there are some parts of the system that are broken in some unpredictable ways even though the rest are working fine. And since partial failures are non-deterministic in a sense that your solution might sometimes unpredictably fail, it distributed systems hard to work with.      Unreliable networks.                  There are many things could go wrong with a networking request such as your request may have been lost, be waiting in a queue, the remote node may have failed, the response has been lost, delayed, and so on.          Network problem can be surprisingly common in practice.          Timeout is normally a good way to detect a fault. Rather than using a configured constant timeouts, system can automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution.                    Unreliable clocks.                  Time is tricky since communication is not instantaneous, it takes time for a message to travel from one point to another, and because of variable delayed in network with multiple machines are involved, it’s hard to determine the order of operations.          Modern computers have at least two different kinds of clock:                          A time-of-day clock, which are usually synchronized with Network Time Protocol (NTP), which means that a timestamp from one machine (ideally) means the same as a timestamp on another machine.              A monotonic clock is suitable for measuring a duration such as a timeout or a service’s response time.                                Time-of-day clocks need to be set according to an NTP in order to be useful though this isn’t as reliable as we hope as he quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate, if a computer’s clock differs too much from an NTP server, it may refuse to synchronize, NTP synchronization can only be as good as the network delay, NTP servers could be wrong or misconfigured, the hardware clock is virtualized in virtual machines, and so on.          If you use software that requires synchronized clocks, it is essential that you also carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines.                    Knowledge, truth and lies.                  A distributed system cannot exclusively rely on a single node, because a node may fail at any time, potentially leaving the system stuck and unable to recover. Instead, many distributed algorithms rely on a quorum where decisions are made by a majority of nodes.          Distributed systems problems become much harder if there is a risk that nodes may lie, such as claiming unreceived messages from other node or sending untrue messages to other nodes, it’s known as Byzantine fault.                      Consistency and consensus.          Most replicated databases provide at least eventual consistency, which means that if you stop writing to the database and wait for some unspecified length of time, then eventually all read requests will return the same value. However, this is a very weak guarantee as it doesn’t say anything about when the replicas will converge. Below we’re looking at stronger consistency models and discussing their trade-offs.      Linearizability makes a system appear as if there was only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic.                  It is useful in such circumstances:                          A system needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader.              Constraints and uniqueness guarantees in database: user’s username or email must be unique, two people can’t have the same seat on a flight,…              Cross-channel timing dependencies: web server and image resizer communicate both through file storage and a message queue, opening the potential for race conditions,…                                CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem to pick 2 out of 3:                          If the application requires linearizability, some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot process requests while they are disconnected, or unavailable.              If the application does not require linearizability, each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replica.              A better way of phrasing CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned                                Few systems are actually linearizable in practice since most of them concern about their performance and availability.                    Ordering guarantees.                  In order to maintain causality, you need to know which operation happened before which other operation. One way is to use sequence numbers or timestamps to order events such as Lamport timestamp.          However, in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for usernames, it’s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations as you also need to know when that order is finalized, aka total order broadcast.          Total order broadcast says that if every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other.                    Distributed transaction and consensus.                  There are several situations in which it is important for nodes to reach consensus such as leader election and atomic commit in database.          2-phase commit (2PC) algorithm is the most common way for achieving atomic transaction commit across multiple nodes.                          2PC uses a new component as a coordinator to manage all nodes.              The application first requests a globally unique transaction ID from the coordinator for transaction.              When the application is ready to commit, the coordinator begins phase 1: send a prepare request to each of the nodes, tagged with the ID, asking them whether they are able to commit.              If all participants reply “yes”, the coordinator sends out a commit request to all nodes in phase 2, while if any of them says “no”, the coordinator sends an abort request.              If the coordinator fails after all participants reply “yes” in phase 1, participants have no way of knowing whether to commit or abort in phase 2. The only way how this can complete is to wait for the coordinator to recover.              Three-phase commit (3PC) has been proposed as alternative to 2PC. However, it assumes a network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times which is not practical in most systems.                                Distributed transactions in practice has mixed reputation. On one hand, they provide an important safety guarantee. On the other hand, it causes operational problems, kill perfomance and so on.                          There are two types of distributed transaction are often conflated: database-internal distributed transactions (distributed databases that support internal transactions among the nodes of that database) and heterogeneous distributed transactions (participants are two or more different technologies).              That said, database-internal distributed transactions can often work quite well though transactions spanning heterogeneous technologies are a lot more challenging.                                The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are Viewstamped Replication (VSR), Paxos, Raft and Zab as most of them provide total order broadcast. However, they’re not used everywhere since they all come with performance costs.          ZooKeeper or etcd implements a consensus algorithm though they are often described as distributed key-value stores. They are not use directly in your application but via some other projects for distributed coordination, work allocation, service discovery, membership services.                    III. Batch and stream processing.  Batch processing.          With basic Unix tools (awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, xarg, pipe,…), one can do a lot of powerful data processing jobs. A simple chain of Unix commands can actually perform surprisingly well as it can easily scale to large datasets, without running out of memory.      MapReduce is a bit like Unix tools, but distributed across potentially thousands of machines.                  While Unix tools use stdin and stdout as input and output, MapReduce jobs read and write files on a distributed filesystem like Google’s GFS.          As the name suggested, 2 callback functions in MapReduce are map and reduce. Map extracts they key and value from the input record while reduce iterates over that collection of values with the same key and produce zero or more outputs. They’re stateless function as they also don’t modify output. Since the input is also bounded, the output is guaranteed to be completed.          The main difference to pipelines of Unix commands is that MapReduce can parallelize a computation across many machines out-of-the-box.          Your code does not need to worry about implementing fault tolerance mechanisms since the framework can guarantee that the final output of a job is the same as if no faults had occurred, even though in reality various tasks perhaps had to be retried.          It’s common for MapReduce jobs to be chained together into workflows, such that the output of one job becomes the input to the next job.          There are several join algorithms for MapReduce such as sort-merge joins, broadcast hash joins, partitioned hash joins that allow us to use joins more efficiently.                      Stream processing.          In batch process, the input is bounded that it’s known and have finite size. In reality, a lot of data is unbounded, arrives gradually over time and never complete in any meaningful way, that batch processors must divide and process them in chunks. However, that takes a long time for impatient users. Stream processing is introduced as it simply processes every event as it happens.      An event is generated once by a producer/publisher/sender and processed by multiple consumers/subscribers/recipients.      A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging system: a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers.                  A number of messaging systems use direct network communication between producers and consumers, without going via intermediary nodes such as UDP multicast, ZeroMQ, webhooks,…          A widely-used alternative is to send messages via a message broker/message queue. Two types of them are:                          AMQP/JMS-style message brokers: the broker assigned individual messages to consumers, consumers acknowledge when they have been successfully processed.              Log-based message brokers: the broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers messages in the same order while consumers keep their logs.                                When multiple consumers are reading messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are load balancing and fan out.                    It’s also useful to think of the writes to a database as a stream that it can capture the changelog, either implicitly through change data capture or explicitly through event sourcing as it also opens up powerful opportunities for integrating systems.                  You can keep derived data systems such as search indexes, caches and analytics systems continually up-to-date by consuming the log of changes and applying them to the derived system.          You can even build fresh views onto existing data by starting from scratch and consuming the log of changes from the beginning all the way to the present.                    Stream processing has long been used for monitoring purposes, where an organization wants to be alerted if certain things happen. However, other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time.                  Complex event processing (CEP) allows you to specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in a stream.          Analytics that are more oriented towards aggregations and statistical metrics over a large number of events are also used.          It can be used to maintain materialized views onto some dataset, so that you can query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying data changes.                    Stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine to determine windowing. Even though it’s simple to implement and reason about, it breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.      There are 3 types of join that may appear in stream processes:                  Stream-stream joins: matching two events that occur within some window of time.          Stream-table joins: one input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database changelog.          Table-table joins: both input streams are database changelogs where every change on one side is joined with the latest state of the other side.                    To tolerate faults, one solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a miniature batch process (microbatching). Other is to use idempotent writes.

Replication, partitioning/sharding, transactions, and what it means to achieve consistency and consensus in a distributed system.</h2><ul>  <li>Replication.    <ul>      <li>Why would you want to replicate data?        <ul>          <li>Reduce latency by keeping data geographically close to users.</li>          <li>Increase availability.</li>          <li>Increase throughput.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>2 types of algorithms are leader-based replication and leaderless replication.</li>      <li>Leader-based replication:        <ul>          <li>Workflow:            <ul>              <li>One of the replicas is designed as the leader while others are followers.</li>              <li>Client must send write request to the leader though can send read request to both leader and followers.</li>              <li>After the leader writes data to its local storage, it sends the changes to all of its followers so that they can self apply accordingly.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>An important detail of a replicated system is whether the replication happens synchronously or asynchronously.            <ul>              <li>Even though the advantage of synchronous replication is that followers is that the follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date data, if the synchronous follower doesn’t respond, the write cannot be processed, thus the leader must block all writes and wait until one is available again.</li>              <li>It is impractical for all followers to be synchronous so leader-based replication is often configured to be completely asynchronous.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>From time to time, you need to set up new followers to increase the number of replicas, or to replace failed nodes. This can usually be done without downtime by maintaining a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database.</li>          <li>If the follower goes down, it can recover quite easily from its logs that it has received from the leader. Later when it’s able to talk to the leader again, it can request all the missing data and catch up to the leader.</li>          <li>If the leader goes down, a possible approach is failover: one of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader using a consensus algorithm, clients and followers need to be configured to talk to the new leader. However, failover can go wrong as well (two leaders, choosing the right timeout before the leader is declared dead,…) as there are no easy solutions to these.</li>          <li>Different implementation of replication logs:            <ul>              <li>Statement-based replication: the leader logs every write request that it executes, and sends that statement log to its followers. Even though it seems reasonable, non-deterministic function, such as NOW() to get current date and time, is likely to generate a different value on each replica.</li>              <li>Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping: similar to B-tree’s approach where every modification is first written to a WAL, besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it to its followers so that they can build a copy of the exact same data structures as found on the leader.</li>              <li>Logical log replication: allow the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine by using different log formats.</li>              <li>Trigger-based replication: register a trigger to only replicate subset of the data, or from one kind of database to another and so on.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Replication lags:            <ul>              <li>If the user view the data shortly after making the write, new data may have not yet reach the replica. In this case, we need read-after-write consistency, meaning we can read from the leader first, so that user always see their latest changes.</li>              <li>If a user makes several reads from different replicas and there’s lagging among replicas, they might not see the correct data. Monotonic reads guarantee that this kind of anomaly does not happen by making sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica.</li>              <li>If some followers are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the answer before they see the question. Preventing this kind of anomaly requires consistent prefix reads so that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.</li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Multi-leader replication:        <ul>          <li>Use cases:            <ul>              <li>Multi-datacenter operation: each datacenter has its own leader. This can improve perfomance, tolerance of datacenter outages though same data may be concurrently modified in two different datacenters, and those write conflicts must be resolved.</li>              <li>Client with offline operation: every client has a local database that acts as a leader, and there is an asynchronous multi-leader replication process (sync) between the replicas on all of your clients.</li>              <li>Real-time collaborative editing: when one user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other users who are editing the same document.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Handling write conflicts:            <ul>              <li>A write conflict can be caused by two leaders concurrently updating the same record. In a single-leader scenario, it can’t happen since the second leader will wait for the first write or abort it. In a multi-leader one, both writes are successful and the conflict can only be detected asynchronously at later point in time.</li>              <li>The simplest way for dealing with multi-leader write conflicts is to avoid them by making sure all writes go through the same designated leader.</li>              <li>Since there is no defined ordering of writes in a multi-leader database, it’s unclear what the final value should be in all replicas. A number of ways to converge to the final value include giving each writes a unique ID and picking one with the highest ID as the winner, somehow merging values together,…</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Topologies: communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another.            <ul>              <li>The most general topology is all-to-all where every leader sends its writes to every other leader. Other popular ones are circular and star topology.</li>              <li>A problem with circular and star topologies is that if one node fails, the path is broken, resulting in some nodes are not connected others.</li>              <li>Even though all-to-all topologies avoid a single point of failure, they can also have issues that some replications are faster and can overtake others. A technique called version vectors can be used to order these events correctly.</li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Leaderless replication: client writes to several replicas or a coordinator node does this on behalf of the client.        <ul>          <li>A failover does not exist in a leaderless replication. If a node is down, client writes to all available replicas in parallel, verify if they’re successful and simply ignore the one unavailable replica. Read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel to avoid stale values.</li>          <li>To ensure all up-to-date data is copied to every replica, two often used mechanisms are read repair (make requests to several nodes in parallel and detect stale values using versioning), anti-entropy process (background process that constantly looks for differences in the data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to another).</li>          <li>If there are n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least r nodes for each read, as long as w + r &gt; n, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading, because at least one of the r nodes we’re reading from must be up-to-date. However, there’re still edge cases when stale values are return:            <ul>              <li>Using a sloppy quorum.</li>              <li>Two writes happen concurrently, or with read.</li>              <li>A node carrying a failed value.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>For multi-datacenter operation, some implementation of leaderless replication keeps all communication between clients and database nodes local to one datacenter, so n describes the number of replicas within one datacenter. Cross-datacenter replication works similarly to multi-leader replication.</li>          <li>Handling concurrent write conflicts:            <ul>              <li>Last write wins: attach a timestamp to each write, pick the biggest timestamp as the most ‘recent’, and discard any writes with a lower timestamp.</li>              <li>Version vectors:                <ul>                  <li>For a singple replica, the algorithm works as follow:                    <ul>                      <li>A server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written.</li>                      <li>A client must read a key before writing. When a client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read.</li>                      <li>When the server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below but it must keep all values with a higher version number.</li>                    </ul>                  </li>                  <li>For multiple replicas:                    <ul>                      <li>We need to use a version number per replica as well as per key.</li>                      <li>Each replica increments its own version number when processing a write, and also keeps track of the version numbers it has seen from all of the other replicas.</li>                    </ul>                  </li>                </ul>              </li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Partitioning/sharding.    <ul>      <li>The main reason for partitioning is scalability: partitions can be distributed across many nodes, disks, and so on.</li>      <li>It is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partitions are stored on multiple nodes.</li>      <li>The goal of partitioning is to spread the data and query load evenly across nodes.</li>      <li>Partitioning of key-value data.        <ul>          <li>One way of partitioning is to assign a continuous range of keys to each partition. However, the downside is that certain patterns can lead to high load.</li>          <li>Another way is to use a hash function to determine the partition for a given key. A downside is the ability to efficiently do range queries as adjacent keys are now scattered across all partitions.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Partitioning and secondary indexes.        <ul>          <li>Partitioning becomes more complicated if secondary indexes are involved since they don’t identify records uniquely but rather, it’s a way of searching for occurrences of a particular value.</li>          <li>Two main approaches are document-based partitioning and term-based partitioning.</li>          <li>With document-based partitioning, each partition maintains its own secondary indexes covering only the documents in that partition. Since it doesn’t care about other partitions, reading from it can be quite expensive since one need to query all partitions and aggregate everything for more exact results.</li>          <li>With term-based partitioning, rather than each partition having its own secondary index, we can construct a global index that covers data in all partitions. This can make reads more efficient rather than doing scatter/gather over all partitions. The downside is that writes are now slower and more complicated, because a write to a single document may now affect multiple partitions of the index.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Rebalancing partitions as we increase our nodes and machines over time.        <ul>          <li>Mod N approach is problematic when the number of nodes N changes, most of the keys need to be moved as well.</li>          <li>A simple solution is to create many more partitions than there are nodes, and assign several partitions to each node. If a new node is added, it can steal a few partitions from every existing node.</li>          <li>Rebalancing can be done automatically, though it won’t hurt to have a human in the loop to help prevent operational surprises.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Request routing/service discovery.        <ul>          <li>After the partitioning and rebalancing, how does the client know which node to connection to?            <ul>              <li>Client can talk to any node and forward the request to the appropriate node if needed.</li>              <li>Client can talk to a routing tier that determines the node that should handle the request and forwards it accordingly.</li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Transactions.    <ul>      <li>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID).        <ul>          <li>Since transactions are often composed of multiple statements, atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single “unit”, which either succeeds completely, or fails completely.</li>          <li>Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.</li>          <li>Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other.</li>          <li>Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Weak isolation levels.        <ul>          <li>Database hides concurrency issues from application developers by providing transaction isolation, especially serializable isolation, by guaranteeing that have transactions the same effect as if they ran serially, one at a time without any concurrency.</li>          <li>In practice, serializable isolation has a performance cost and many databases don’t want to pay that price.

When a transaction wants to commit, it is checked, and aborted if the execution was not serializable.</li>            </ul>          </li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Things that may go wrong in a distributed system.    <ul>      <li>A partial failure is when there are some parts of the system that are broken in some unpredictable ways even though the rest are working fine. And since partial failures are non-deterministic in a sense that your solution might sometimes unpredictably fail, it distributed systems hard to work with.</li>      <li>Unreliable networks.        <ul>          <li>There are many things could go wrong with a networking request such as your request may have been lost, be waiting in a queue, the remote node may have failed, the response has been lost, delayed, and so on.</li>          <li>Network problem can be surprisingly common in practice.</li>          <li>Timeout is normally a good way to detect a fault. Rather than using a configured constant timeouts, system can automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Unreliable clocks.        <ul>          <li>Time is tricky since communication is not instantaneous, it takes time for a message to travel from one point to another, and because of variable delayed in network with multiple machines are involved, it’s hard to determine the order of operations.</li>          <li>Modern computers have at least two different kinds of clock:            <ul>              <li>A time-of-day clock, which are usually synchronized with Network Time Protocol (NTP), which means that a timestamp from one machine (ideally) means the same as a timestamp on another machine.</li>              <li>A monotonic clock is suitable for measuring a duration such as a timeout or a service’s response time.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Time-of-day clocks need to be set according to an NTP in order to be useful though this isn’t as reliable as we hope as he quartz clock in a computer is not very accurate, if a computer’s clock differs too much from an NTP server, it may refuse to synchronize, NTP synchronization can only be as good as the network delay, NTP servers could be wrong or misconfigured, the hardware clock is virtualized in virtual machines, and so on.</li>          <li>If you use software that requires synchronized clocks, it is essential that you also carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Knowledge, truth and lies.        <ul>          <li>A distributed system cannot exclusively rely on a single node, because a node may fail at any time, potentially leaving the system stuck and unable to recover. Instead, many distributed algorithms rely on a quorum where decisions are made by a majority of nodes.</li>          <li>Distributed systems problems become much harder if there is a risk that nodes may lie, such as claiming unreceived messages from other node or sending untrue messages to other nodes, it’s known as Byzantine fault.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Consistency and consensus.    <ul>      <li>Most replicated databases provide at least eventual consistency, which means that if you stop writing to the database and wait for some unspecified length of time, then eventually all read requests will return the same value. However, this is a very weak guarantee as it doesn’t say anything about when the replicas will converge. Below we’re looking at stronger consistency models and discussing their trade-offs.</li>      <li>Linearizability makes a system appear as if there was only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic.        <ul>          <li>It is useful in such circumstances:            <ul>              <li>A system needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader.</li>              <li>Constraints and uniqueness guarantees in database: user’s username or email must be unique, two people can’t have the same seat on a flight,…</li>              <li>Cross-channel timing dependencies: web server and image resizer communicate both through file storage and a message queue, opening the potential for race conditions,…</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem to pick 2 out of 3:            <ul>              <li>If the application requires linearizability, some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot process requests while they are disconnected, or unavailable.</li>              <li>If the application does not require linearizability, each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replica.</li>              <li>A better way of phrasing CAP would be either Consistent or Available when Partitioned</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Few systems are actually linearizable in practice since most of them concern about their performance and availability.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Ordering guarantees.        <ul>          <li>In order to maintain causality, you need to know which operation happened before which other operation. One way is to use sequence numbers or timestamps to order events such as Lamport timestamp.</li>          <li>However, in order to implement something like a uniqueness constraint for usernames, it’s not sufficient to have a total ordering of operations as you also need to know when that order is finalized, aka total order broadcast.</li>          <li>Total order broadcast says that if every message represents a write to the database, and every replica processes the same writes in the same order, then the replicas will remain consistent with each other.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Distributed transaction and consensus.        <ul>          <li>There are several situations in which it is important for nodes to reach consensus such as leader election and atomic commit in database.</li>          <li>2-phase commit (2PC) algorithm is the most common way for achieving atomic transaction commit across multiple nodes.            <ul>              <li>2PC uses a new component as a coordinator to manage all nodes.</li>              <li>The application first requests a globally unique transaction ID from the coordinator for transaction.</li>              <li>When the application is ready to commit, the coordinator begins phase 1: send a prepare request to each of the nodes, tagged with the ID, asking them whether they are able to commit.</li>              <li>If all participants reply “yes”, the coordinator sends out a commit request to all nodes in phase 2, while if any of them says “no”, the coordinator sends an abort request.</li>              <li>If the coordinator fails after all participants reply “yes” in phase 1, participants have no way of knowing whether to commit or abort in phase 2. The only way how this can complete is to wait for the coordinator to recover.</li>              <li>Three-phase commit (3PC) has been proposed as alternative to 2PC. However, it assumes a network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times which is not practical in most systems.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>Distributed transactions in practice has mixed reputation. On one hand, they provide an important safety guarantee. On the other hand, it causes operational problems, kill perfomance and so on.            <ul>              <li>There are two types of distributed transaction are often conflated: database-internal distributed transactions (distributed databases that support internal transactions among the nodes of that database) and heterogeneous distributed transactions (participants are two or more different technologies).</li>              <li>That said, database-internal distributed transactions can often work quite well though transactions spanning heterogeneous technologies are a lot more challenging.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are Viewstamped Replication (VSR), Paxos, Raft and Zab as most of them provide total order broadcast. However, they’re not used everywhere since they all come with performance costs.</li>          <li>ZooKeeper or etcd implements a consensus algorithm though they are often described as distributed key-value stores. They are not use directly in your application but via some other projects for distributed coordination, work allocation, service discovery, membership services.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li></ul><h2 id=\"iii-batch-and-stream-processing\">III. Batch and stream processing.</h2><ul>  <li>Batch processing.    <ul>      <li>With basic Unix tools (awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, xarg, pipe,…), one can do a lot of powerful data processing jobs. A simple chain of Unix commands can actually perform surprisingly well as it can easily scale to large datasets, without running out of memory.</li>      <li>MapReduce is a bit like Unix tools, but distributed across potentially thousands of machines.        <ul>          <li>While Unix tools use stdin and stdout as input and output, MapReduce jobs read and write files on a distributed filesystem like Google’s GFS.</li>          <li>As the name suggested, 2 callback functions in MapReduce are map and reduce. Map extracts they key and value from the input record while reduce iterates over that collection of values with the same key and produce zero or more outputs. They’re stateless function as they also don’t modify output. Since the input is also bounded, the output is guaranteed to be completed.</li>          <li>The main difference to pipelines of Unix commands is that MapReduce can parallelize a computation across many machines out-of-the-box.</li>          <li>Your code does not need to worry about implementing fault tolerance mechanisms since the framework can guarantee that the final output of a job is the same as if no faults had occurred, even though in reality various tasks perhaps had to be retried.</li>          <li>It’s common for MapReduce jobs to be chained together into workflows, such that the output of one job becomes the input to the next job.</li>          <li>There are several join algorithms for MapReduce such as sort-merge joins, broadcast hash joins, partitioned hash joins that allow us to use joins more efficiently.</li>        </ul>      </li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Stream processing.    <ul>      <li>In batch process, the input is bounded that it’s known and have finite size. In reality, a lot of data is unbounded, arrives gradually over time and never complete in any meaningful way, that batch processors must divide and process them in chunks. However, that takes a long time for impatient users. Stream processing is introduced as it simply processes every event as it happens.</li>      <li>An event is generated once by a producer/publisher/sender and processed by multiple consumers/subscribers/recipients.</li>      <li>A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging system: a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers.        <ul>          <li>A number of messaging systems use direct network communication between producers and consumers, without going via intermediary nodes such as UDP multicast, ZeroMQ, webhooks,…</li>          <li>A widely-used alternative is to send messages via a message broker/message queue. Two types of them are:            <ul>              <li>AMQP/JMS-style message brokers: the broker assigned individual messages to consumers, consumers acknowledge when they have been successfully processed.</li>              <li>Log-based message brokers: the broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers messages in the same order while consumers keep their logs.</li>            </ul>          </li>          <li>When multiple consumers are reading messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are load balancing and fan out.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>It’s also useful to think of the writes to a database as a stream that it can capture the changelog, either implicitly through change data capture or explicitly through event sourcing as it also opens up powerful opportunities for integrating systems.        <ul>          <li>You can keep derived data systems such as search indexes, caches and analytics systems continually up-to-date by consuming the log of changes and applying them to the derived system.</li>          <li>You can even build fresh views onto existing data by starting from scratch and consuming the log of changes from the beginning all the way to the present.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Stream processing has long been used for monitoring purposes, where an organization wants to be alerted if certain things happen. However, other uses of stream processing have also emerged over time.        <ul>          <li>Complex event processing (CEP) allows you to specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in a stream.</li>          <li>Analytics that are more oriented towards aggregations and statistical metrics over a large number of events are also used.</li>          <li>It can be used to maintain materialized views onto some dataset, so that you can query it efficiently, and updating that view whenever the underlying data changes.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>Stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine to determine windowing. Even though it’s simple to implement and reason about, it breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.</li>      <li>There are 3 types of join that may appear in stream processes:        <ul>          <li>Stream-stream joins: matching two events that occur within some window of time.</li>          <li>Stream-table joins: one input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database changelog.</li>          <li>Table-table joins: both input streams are database changelogs where every change on one side is joined with the latest state of the other side.</li>        </ul>      </li>      <li>To tolerate faults, one solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a miniature batch process (microbatching). Other is to use idempotent writes.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><hr /><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID</a></li></ul>",

            "content_text": "  Taking to customer is hard.          Conversations take time and easy to screw up.      Bad conversations give you a false positive which convince you that you’re on the right path when you’re not.        You shouldn’t ask your mom or anyone whether your business is a good idea because it’s a bad question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little.  The Mom Test is a set of 3 simple rules for crating good questions that even your mom can’t lie about:          Talk about their lives instead of your idea.      Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.      Talk less and listen more.        Fix a bad question.          “Do you think it’s a good idea?”                  Only the market can tell you if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion.          Instead, ask how they currently do it, which parts they love and hate, which solutions they tried before settling in this one, are they actively seeking for replacement, why and why not,…                    “Would you buy a product which did X?”                  You’re asking overly optimistic people who want to make you happy by always answering “Yes”.          Instead, ask how they currently solve X, how much it costs to do so, how much time it takes, talk through what happened last time X came up, why and why not, are they seeking for better solutions,…                    “How much would you pay for X”                  Similar to the last one, except the number makes it feel truthy.          Instead, ask how much does the problem cost them, how much do they currently pay to solve it, how big is their budget,…                    “Would you pay X for a product which did Y?”                  As always, ask what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future.                      None of good these questions are about what you should build but customers’ problems, cares and goals. People don’t know what they want in a product, it’s your job to gather good information, come up with a solution and verify it.          “What would your dream product do?” and ask follow-up questions to try to understand why they want these features as well.      “Why do you bother?” to dig down into their goals, pain points and motivations.      “What are the implications of that?” to distinguishes between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems and thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it problem since some problems don’t matter or worth spending time with.      “Talk me through the last time that happened” to learn through their actions instead of their opinions.      “What else have you tried?”, “How are you dealing with it now?”,  what they love/hate, how much does it cost, how much would those fixes be worth, how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution.      “Where does the money come from?”, whose budget the purchase will come from, who holds the power to seal the deal.      End every conversation with “Who else should I talk to?”, “Is there anything else I should have asked?” can lead to more deals.        Avoiding 3 types of bad data.          Compliments.                  They don’t give you any meaningful data.          Try to be more specific. Why did that person like the idea, how much money would it save him, what else has he tried which failed to solve his problem,…                    Fluff: generics (“usually”, “always”, “never”), hypotheticals (“might”, “could”), and the future (“would”, “will”).                  Be more specific.          Ask when it last happened, talk through it, how they solved it, what else they tried.                    Ideas.                  Take a moment to dig into the motivations behind the idea/feature request.          Why do you want that? What would that let you do? How are you coping without it? Do you think we could push back the launch to add that feature? How would that fit into your day?          Tell me more about that. That seems to really bug you. What makes it so aweful? Why haven’t you been able to fix it already? Is this a big deal? Why so happy?                      Keeping it casual.          Strip all the formality from the process.      Make it a quick and casual chat.        Commitment and advancement.          A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the next step.      Commitment can either be time, reputation risk, or fiance.                  Time commitment include: having a clear next meeting with known goals, sitting down to give feedback, using a trial.          Reputation risk include: intro to peers/team or a decision maker (boss, lawyer), giving a public testimonial or case study.          Financial commitment include: letter of intent to purchase, pre-order, deposit.                    A bad meeting can be saved just pushing for a commitment at the end.                  “That’s so cool. I love it!”: deflect the compliment and get back to business.          “Looks great. Let me know when it launches.”: look for a commitment I could ask for today.          “There are a couple people I can intro you to when you’re ready.”: ask who they want to introduce you to, what “ready” means, why he can’t make the intro now,…          “I would definitely buy that.”: ask for a letter of intent/a pre-purchase/deposit/intros to other decision makers and team members,…                      If you already know your customers, go talk to them. If you don’t know, how to find these conversations?          Cold calls are hard, though having only one to start the train.                  Try to keep it informal. Don’t even need to mention you have a business. Have a good conversation. Be interested in other people’s problems.                    Instead of reaching out to them, what can you offer what will make them want to talk to you?                  Organize meetups, give talks at conferences, host workshops, teach through videos, blogging,…                    Reach out to general audiences and ask for references. Everyone knows someone. We just need to ask.      Find advisors, including industry experts as well as professors.      Find investors.      5 key elements of a good reach-out:                  You’re trying to solve problem X. Don’t mention your idea.          Mention what stage you’re at and you don’t have anything to sell.          Mention specific problems you need their help on.          Show them how much they can help.          Ask for help.                    For example:                  “Hey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and ultimately effective.”          “We’re having a load of trouble figuring out how all the pieces of the industry fit together and where we can best fit into it (weakness). You know more about this industry than anyone and could really save us from a ton of mistakes (pedestal).”          “We’re funded and have a couple products out already, but this is in no way a sales meeting – we’re just moving into a new area and could really use some of your expertise (framing).”          “Can you spare a bit of time in the next week to help point us in the right direction over a coffee? (ask)”                      Talking to a lot of different people leads to confusing signals and overwhelming options and feedbacks that hard to make sense of. How do you choose then?          Categorize customers in different group and evaluate which group seems most profitable, easy to read and rewarding for us.        Running the process.          Before the conversation: decide 3 big learning goals, guess what they care about so that we can compare with our notes later.      During the conversation: keep it casual, ask good questions, take good notes, press for commitment and next steps.      After the conversation: review notes with team, transfer to a permanent storage that is searchable.      References:  http://momtestbook.com/",

            "content_text": "  Focus on high-leverage activities.          Leverage: impact produced / time invested.      80/20 rule: 80% impact comes from 20% work.      Focus on not more hours but more value per limited time on the task.      Increase leverage by:                  Reduce the time it takes to complete the activity (default to half-hour meeting instead of one-hour one, automate manual dev process).          Increase the value produced (have a clear agenda beforehand, prioritize tasks based on launch date).          Shift to higher-leverage activities (use email instead of in-person discussion, talk to customer).                    Output can be measured by:                  Number of projects launched          Bug fixes          Users acquired          Engineers hired          Quality          Revenue generated                      Understand the power of compound interest.          Compounding leads to an exponential growth curve.      The earlier compounding starts, the sooner it hits the exponential growth, the faster you can reap its benefits.      Small deltas in the interest rate can make massive differences in the long run:                  Improving by 1% per day makes us 37x better at the end of year.          Google idea of 20% where engineers spend about 1 day a week on a side project to make the company better results in successful products such as Gmail , Google News, Adsense,…                      Optimize for learning because learning compounds.          Find fast growing work environment.      Take advantage of the resources at your work.                  Study code from best engineers.          Write more code.          Go through technical, educational material.          Send code views to the harshest critics.          Participate in design discussions - don’t wait for invitation.          Team with senior engineers.                    Invest in other skills too.                  Invest in skills that are in high demand.          Build strong relationships.          Read books.          Write to teach.          Pursue side projects.                      Prioritize regularly.          Track TODO list in a single list.      Sort the list frequently by asking yourself on a recurring basis:                  Is there anything else I could be doing that’s higher-leverage?                          Focus on what directly produce value (products shipped, user acquired, business metrics moved, sales made).              Focus on the important and non-urgent (planning career goals, building relationships, personal development, improving workflow).                                          Preserve larger blocks of focused time + learn to say no to unimportant activities.      Limit the amount of work in progress + resist the urge to work on too many projects at once.      Make it a habit.        Iterate quickly to build more and learn faster.          Invest in time-saving tools.                  Bringing the release time down to several minutes helps the team deploy more frequently, 40-50 times a day - skyrockets growth.          If it saves you 1 hour a day, it saves 10 people 10 times as much.                    Measure the progress frequently.        Validate early and often.          A well tested, clean design, scalable product doesn’t deliver much value if users don’t engage or customers don’t buy it.      Bounce ideas off teammates.        Define measurable milestones.References:  https://www.effectiveengineer.com/book",

            "summary": null,
            "content_text": "  What is a good life according to Stoicism?          Having a good life is not about making a good living, aka having a high-paying job since one could hate the job or have conflicting thoughts about its moral.      A person must be virtuous in order to have a good life.                  A person’s virtue depends on their excellence as a human being, how well one performs the function for which humans were designed.                          A virtuous hammer is one that can drive nails well, a virtuous scissors is one that can cut well.                                To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, that is to reason, to do certain things, to have certain duties. For example, one of which is the social duty that is to honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends,…                      Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good life:          Negative visualization:                  Bad things happen, no matter how hard we try to prevent them. Assuming we will always be able to enjoy things we value causes us distress when they are taken from us.          We are unhappy largely because we’re insatiable. After working hard for what we desire, we quickly get bored, dissatisfied, take things for granted and eventually chase new desire.                          Consumer purchase: longing for a new TV, laptop, phone after buying one several weeks ago              Job: wanting higher pay, new workplace, new boss after landing the job of our dreams              Relationship: fantasizing about starting a new relationship after marriage                                The solution is to forestall the adaptation process, even better reverse it so that we stop taking things for granted and desire what we already have.                          Image that we have lost the things we value, our wife has left, our relatives and friends were death, we lost our job, our house, our money and so on.              As we go about our day, reflect periodically that we will not live forever and this day could be our last. The goal is not to change our activities but our state of mind that we carry out these activities and appreciate today.                                Most of us are already living the dream, having a wonderful partner, a dream job, a good car though we take things for granted other than delighting in them. Some are less fortunate, still the practice of negative still can be applied.          Being satisfied with what we’ve got doesn’t mean we shouldn’t seek certain things in life or strive to become better.                    Trichotomy of control:                  There are things over which we have:                          Complete control: goals we set for ourself, opinions and values we form              No control: whether the sun will rise tomorrow              Some but not complete control: whether we will win a competition or become a millionaire though we try really hard for it                                We should not concern ourselves with things that we have no control of.          If we want things that we have less or no control, we will sometimes fail to get what we want, be upset and anxious about it.          A strategy to deal with things that we have less or no control is to be careful about the goals and values that we form.                          Instead of setting a goal to win a competition, which we only have partial control, set a goal to do our best in the match, which we have complete control.              We’ll free ourself from frustration or disappointment if we lose.                                          Fatalism:                  We must learn to welcome whatever comes to us and trust that it happens is for the best.          We have no control of the past as well as the present (this very moment). That said, we’re wasting time worrying about past and present events.          Instead of wishing it could be different, embrace it.                    Self-denial (extension of negative visualization):                  Besides contemplating bad things happening, we should sometimes live as if they had happened, cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could have avoided (experience cold weather even though clothes are at hand).          Benefits of voluntary discomfort:                          Harden ourselves against misfortune that might happen in the future.              Grow confident that we can withstand major discomfort.              Help us appreciate what we have.                                Besides practicing voluntary discomfort, we should sometimes forgo opportunities to experience pleasure, choose not to do things that make us feel good (eating carb and sugar).          Willpower is like muscle power: the more exercise, the stronger they are; the more will power we have, the more self-control and courage we have.                    Meditation:                  On the events of daily living at bedtime:                          Did something disrupt our tranquility?              Did we experience anger/envy/lust?              Is there something that I could avoid?                                On our Stoic progress:                          Do we periodically engage in negative visualization?              Do we take time to distinguish between these things over which we have control, less and no control?              Are we careful to initialize our goals?              Have we refrained from dwelling on the past and instead focused our attention on the future?              Have we consciously practiced acts of self-denial?                                            Advice on daily living:          How to think about social duty:                  We were designed to live among other people and interact with them in a manner that is advantageous.          To fulfill this social duty, we must feel a concern for all humankind, to do good and bear with them.                    How to preserve tranquility while interacting with other people:                  We can’t be selective in doing our social duty (dealing with annoying, misguided people) though we can be selective about whom we befriend, ones that share our values.          When dealing with annoying people, keep in mind that there are people that find us annoying as well so that we can also reflect on our shortcomings and become more empathetic to others’ faults.          Due to fatalism, we should operate on the assumption that annoying people are fated to behave that way and it’s expectable (though they can be changed of course).          The risk in dealing with annoying people is that they will make us hate them, though that only makes us more like them. The best revenge is to refuse to do so.                    How to deal with insult:                  What upsets us is not things themselves but our judgments about these things.          When insulted, pause and consider if what the insulter said is true, how well-inform the insulter is, or if we respect him.                          If it’s true or we respect the insulter, we should reflect on ourselves and strive to be better.              If not, we should feel relived because it’s the right thing to do as we don’t need their approval.                                  If a dog barks us, we don’t be upset by the fact that he might dislike us.                                                              One of the best way to respond to insult is with humor, especially self-deprecating jokes. Another way is with no response.                          By not responding to the insulter, we are robbing him the pleasure of having upset us which is likely to make him upset as a result.              Also, no one wants to be ignored and the insulter is likely to feel humiliated then.                                          How to respond to the death:                  It’s not possible to eliminate grief but possible to minimize the amount of grief we experience in our life.          One strategy that is mentioned above is negative visualization.          Remember that the person whose death that we’re grieving wouldn’t want us to be tortured with tears.                    How to overcome anger/anti-joy:                  We should fight our tendency to believe the worst about other and our tendency to jump to conclusion about their motivations.          Things that anger us generally don’t do us any real harm. Sometimes things that we think are important are actually are not that important.          Humor can help if we choose to think that bad things happening to us is funny and amusing.          When angry, force ourselves to relax our face, soften our voice, slow our pace of walking and so on.                    How to think about fame:                  If we seek social status, we give other people power over us in a sense that we have to do things that make them admire us. In other words, we will have enslaved ourselves.          We should be confident about ourselves and our values and ignore what people think of us.                    How to think about wealth/luxurious living:                  There’s a danger that if we’re exposed to a luxurious lifestyle, we will lose our ability to take delight in simple things.                          We become harder to please.              Our standards are constantly getting higher as we want nothing but the best.              Once it starts, it’s difficult to stop.                                Luxurious lifestyle is harder to maintain and keep up with.          People who achieve luxurious lifestyle are rarely satisfied or happy since they will only learn that they crave even more luxury.          Even though a Stoic doesn’t pursue wealth, they nevertheless acquire it. It’s acceptable for them to enjoy wealth, as long as they are careful not to cling to it. Also, by the practice of negative visualization, they should be prepared as their wealth can be taken away from them anytime.

            "content_text": "  Fragile things are exposed to volatility, robust things resist it, antifragile things benefit from it.  The antifragile system is made up of fragile parts.          The weak one dies in the process while the strong one stays.      Individual failure can provide helpful information to strengthen the system as a whole.        Shock and stressors strengthen antifragile system by forcing them to build up capacity.          When human bounce back after traumatic accidents, hardships or failures, they become stronger.      Lifting heavy puts the body to unusual stress and makes the muscle stronger.      Even though The Titanic was a disaster, it made the ship cruising system stronger.        Trying to over-control systems often leads to fragility.          Mom who overprotects her children prevents them from developing the ability to bounce back and adapt to future difficulties.        To take advantage of antifragility, you don’t need to understand the opportunities you see, just when to seize them.          Society put too much value on theoretical or academic knowledge and not too much on a practical one.      Often the most successful traders don’t know complicated economic theory or finance; they know when to buy and sell.      The Industrial Revolution was not instigated by academics but hobbyists.        The shorter the time frame you observe an event, the higher the noise you will perceive.  Prediction in the modern world is impossible.          We always find patterns, causes, explanations in past events, but they are useless for predicting the future.      An assumption that the worst event we have witnessed must be the worst that could ever happen is simply false.      What’s most likely to stick in the future is what has already been around for long.      Instead of trying to predict what is going to happen, position yourself in such a way that you have optionality.                  The more options you have, the more ways you have to respond to unforeseen events (but not too many options).          Prepare for failure scenarios.                      Squeeze is a situation where you have no choice but to do it, regardless of the cost.          They are the opposite of options.      The larger something is, the harder the squeeze, the more damage it causes.      Still, the larger something is, the harder it will be hit by unexpected events.        The Barbell Strategy suggests to play it safe on one side so that you can take more risks on other side.          Cover your downside to protect yourself from extreme harm.      Let the upside take care of itself.                  If the risky part plays out badly, you’re still fine.          If a Black Swan event makes the risks pay off big, you profit handsomely.                      Practical activities:          Lift heavy weights or do HIIT.      Practice intermittent fasting.      Eat fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, pickles,…      Cold/heat exposure.                  Take cold showers, ice baths, wear less clothes and sleep only with your sheets.          Take saunas, do Bikram yoga and get a sweat on during training.                    Put most of your money in safe investments and 10% in highly lucrative ones.      Keep your day job but take massive action on your side hustle at night.      References:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile  http://siimland.com/become-antifragile/",

            "content_text": "  Takedowns.          Today is a new reality where anyone can be in business.                  Informations are easy to access and within reach.          It’s easy to work from home or collaborate with others across the globe.          Stuff that was impossible is simple today.                    Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can’t control.                  Plans are guesses.          Don’t be obsess you it. It’s OK to wing.          Figure out what’s the next most important thing and do it.                    Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. As long as it’s sustainable and profitable, you should be proud.      Working more doesn’t mean you get more done.        Go.          If you’re going to do something, do something that matters.                  To do great work, you need to feel you’re making a different, putting a meaningful dent in the universe, that you’re part of something important. You don’t have to cure cancer. You want your customer say it makes their lives better.          You should feel an urgency too as you don’t live forever. Don’t wait for someone to make the changes you want to see.                    The easiest way to create a product/service is to make something you want to use.                  Solve your own problem first as you know what you need the most.                    Having the idea has nothing to do with actually making it.                  Start creating.          Ideas are cheap, how you execute them are what matters.                    Perfect time never comes as you’re always too busy doing something else. Do it now.      Always know why you’re doing what you’re doing. Stand for something and be proud of it.      Avoid outside funding as much as you can.                  Service businesses don’t require much capital to bootstrap anyway.          Taking people money means you have less control of your business and more human problem.          You need less than you think. Stay lean. Be frugal.                    Think about profit from day one.      Think about commitment strategy (how to grow and succeed), not exit strategy. Focus on getting customers to love you, not about worrying who’s going to buy you.        Progress.          Focus on the core product itself, ignore the details early on.      Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Do it and reflect.      Stick to the essential. Cut out unnecessary details, simplify, sort out what truly matters.      Once your product does what it needs to do at the minimum, get it out there.        Productivity.          Start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction.      Ensure that you’re doing work that matters?                  Why are you doing this?          What is the problem, exactly?          Is it actually useful?          Is it adding value at all?          Is there an easier way?          What could you be doing instead?          Is this really worth it?                    Interruption is the enemy of productivity.      Avoid meetings as they’re unproductive most of the time. Only meet when:                  Have a set time.          Invite as few people as possible.          Have a clear agenda.          Begin with a specific problem.          End with a solution and implementation plan.                    When good enough gets the job done, go for it. You can usually turn good enough to great later.      Build momentum by accomplishing small wins regularly.      Have enough sleep everyday.      Break your time frames into smaller chunks and estimate accordingly.      Use a small todo list.        Competitors.          Don’t copy competitors since you don’t know their why. Instead, believe your way.      Instead of trying to win a competitor, focus on quality (really good basic features) instead of quantities (more features).      Don’t spend too much time worrying about competitors. Focus on improving yourself instead.        Evolution.          Learn to say no.      Ask for feedbacks and ideas with enthusiasm but always evaluate the priority with a calm mind.        Promotion.          When it’s early, it’s easier to take risks without worrying about embarrassing yourself.      Build an audience.                  Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos, and so on.          Share valuable information and slowly grow your fan.          Get people interested in what you have to say.                    Teaching/sharing educational content is one of the best marketing tactics.      Be genuine. Be transparent.      Have personal, meaningful press releases instead of vague and generic ones.      As long you have something to sell, don’t be afraid to give things away for free.        Hiring.          Do it yourself first to understand what it takes.      Hire when you can’t do it no more.      Pass on hiring people you don’t need.      Hire slowly.      How long someone’s been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well.      Hire the best talent, regardless where it is.      Best way to test-drive applicants is to see them work. Hire for a mini project and go from there.        Getting real.References:  https://basecamp.com/books/rework",

Motivation factors are challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth.                          Motivation is less about the external stimulation but more about what’s inside of you and your work.              It’s a job that truly meaningful to you, is challenging and intersting, allows you to grow professionally, provides you good oppoturnities,…                                One of the easiest mistake is to focus on over-satisfy the hygiene factors over the motivation factors.                          Better salaries, more prestigious title, nicer office are not gonna make you happy.              That said, ask yourself frequently:                                  Is this work meaningful to me?                  Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?                  Am I going to learn new things?                  Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?                  Am I going to be given responsibility?                                                                        How to find a career that both motivates you and satisfies the hygiene factors?                  Before taking a job, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy.                          Is this something that you enjoy doing?              What evidence do you have?                                Find ways to to test these assumptions.                    How to make sure you’re heading in the right decision on a daily basis?                  Look at how you manage your resources - time, energy, talent, wealth.          Prioritize on things that require long-term investment (building a good relationship with your family, building a business, raising a child,…)                          It’s often sad to see the same patterns happening over again in the personal lives of many ambituos people - though they believe that family is important, they actually allocate few resources for them.                                            Find happiness in your relationships:          Relationships with family and close friends are one the greatest sources of happiness in life.      It needs CONSISTENT attention and care, though it’s difficult because.                  You’ll be routinely tempted to invest your resources elsewhere that provide you a more immediate payoff.          Your family and friends rarely shout the loudest to demand your attention.                    The clock of building a fulfilling relationship is ticking from the start.      Understand what’s the most important to the other person by asking yourself “What job does one most need me to do?”.      Children need to do more than learning new skills.                  Allow them to be challenged, let them solve hard problems independently and develop values themselves.          Don’t afraid to let them fail.                      Live a life of integrity (or stay out of jail):          Integrity requires constant self-awareness.      The best way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions is to never start making one in the first place.

            "content_text": "  The starting line:          Build less: less features, options, people, meetings, promises.      Solve your problem.                  You know what’s is important and what’s not for the product itself.          It’s likely people have the same problem so now you have a market too.                    Fund yourself                  Outside funding is plan B.          Investors want their money back quickly -&gt; overhead + other complicated things follow.          Money constraints force you to focus + allow creativity.                    Fix time and budget, flex scope: better to launch great thing, on time, on a budget in small scope than big ones with many holes.      Pick up an enemy and use it as an motivation to tell better story.      If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong.        Stay lean.          Simplify + focus.      Lower the cost of change -&gt; change faster (huge advantage over big company).      Start with 3 people: a developer, a designer, and a sweeper who can roam between both world.      Work with your limited resources. Forget about VC, long release cycles, quick hires,…      Stay small and friendly -&gt; get closer to customer.        Priorities.          What is the app vision? Why does it exit? What makes it different?      Don’t get too deep in the details early one. Ship it first and optimize it later.      Don’t waste time on problems you don’t have yet:                  Scaling to millions of users? Stop dreaming! Majority of apps are never going to reach that phase. Worry about it later once it’s wildly successful.          Make decisions in time.                    Find the right audience.                  Narrow the market.          Focus on the nice or small group of people who wants the product the most.          Don’t try to please everyone.                    Make opinionated software, choose side, like every great companies (Apple, Google, Nitendo).        Feature selection.          What is the heart of the app?                  Forget milestone, TODO lists.          Just focus on the essential.          Let it gain traction. Then add to that foundation.                    Focus on what matters, REALLY. Cut off everything else.      Learn to say no because you have to do that a lot.      For every new feature, you need to:                  Say no.          Force the feature to provide its value.          If no, end. If yes, continue.          Sketch the UI.          Design the UI.          Code.          Test, tweak, repeat.          Document.          Market.          Revisit pricing options, term of service.          Launch.                    Build something that you can manage, organizationally, strategically, financially.      Don’t worry too much about feature requests. Customers will constantly remind you about that.      Ask customer what they don’t want too and simplify it if possible.        Process.          Get something real up and running quickly: it’s OK to do less, skip details, take shortcuts.                  Fail fast and learn.          Avoid unproductive scheduling and action faking (doing bullshit works that feel “productive” that doesn’t get you closer to launching).                    Idea-to-implementation cycle.                  What does the app need to do? What exactly are you going to make?          Sketch it out on paper.          Create mock-up html screens.          Code.                    Allowing options/preferences for customers is not necessarily helping them.                  If you make a bad call, they will complain, then you can fix it.                    Execute. Build momentum. Move on.      Test in the wild.                  Get it out there. Get real results + feedback.          Instead of having a beta version and a release version, have beta features in side the release one so you can have real data + workflow.          Break it down into smaller problems and solve it one by one.                      Organization.          Build a healthy organization.      Utilize your alone time to get work done.      Meetings are normally unproductive.      Have fewer meetings.      Only have it with a clear agenda.      Release something today. Celebrate small victories.        Staffing.          Hire less, only when it’s really needed.      Working with prospective employees on a real project can give a lot of insights. However, not everyone has time for that.      Look at people codes + contribution on open-source projects.      Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists.      Go for happy one.      Hire good writers because they know how to communicate.        Interface.          Design the interface before you start coding.      Start from the core page and build outward. Focus on what matters.      For each page, consider these 3 states:                  Blank: the screen before data is entered (could insert quick tutorials, help blurbs, examples with mock data,…)          Regular: normal page          Error: when shit happens                    It’s OK to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way      Every letter matters.                  Don’t sound like an engineer talking to another engineer.          Keep it short and sweet.                    Incorporate admin function into public interfaces so you don’t need to manage 2 different versions.        Code.          Keep it simple. But be mindful about technical debt.      Less maintenance and support work.      Low cost of change.      Fewer bugs.      Choose the tools that everyone is happy and productive with.      Get data into the world via RSS, API,…        Words.          Document what is needed but nothing else.      Write stories, not details.                  Don’t get into the technical/design details, just a quick story.          Treat it as a normal conversation.                    Use real data if possible, not dummy text all the time -&gt; focus on the UX.      What is your product’s personality type?        Pricing and signup          Give something for free. Let  people experience and see its usefulness.      Make signup and cancellation easy.      Avoid long term contract, signup fee,…        Promotion.          Teaser (dropping hints), preview, launch.      Build a promo site: overview, tour, screenshots, videos, manifesto, case studies, buzz (customers, press reviews,…), forum, pricing and signup, blog,…      Blogging can be more effective (and cheaper) than advertising. Could write about advices, tips, tricks, links,…      Start collecting emails asap.      Share your knowledge. Teaching/educating is a great way to market yourself and your product too.                  Blog (as above).          Speak at conferences.          Conduct workshops.          Give interviews.          Write articles/books                    Track your online present. Leave comments, thank you notes, response to negative ones thoughtfully.      Promote upgrade, in-app purchases.      Pick an short, catchy, memorable name.        Support.          Feel the pain yourself. Don’t outsource. Learn from it.      Use inline help and FAQ instead of giving manual training.      Just response quickly even if you don’t have a perfect answer (during business hour).      Also thank them for their input.      Be willing to say no.      Use forum or chat to let customers help each other.      Be open, honest, transparent (yeah bad news).        Post launch.          Issue a major update 30 days after launch.      Don’t stop blogging: new FAQs, tutorials, news, features, updates, fixes, buzz/press.      Prioritize your bugs.      Wait before the storm, 1-2 days after releasing a new feature and hearing complaints, then take action.      Know your competitors.      More mature doesn’t mean more complicated, as long as you provide valuable services that’s fine.      Be open to new paths and changes in direction .

Each person has a characteristic level of happiness that each is born with.      It’s not a set point but a range.      The challenge is to understand C and V in order to push H to the top of the range.        The 2 biggest parts of C are love and pursuing the right goals.          We are social creatures in a sense that we can’t be happy without having friends and secure attachments. To love well is to have good relationships with other people.      The right goals are ones that produce states of flow and engagement.      Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness.                  According to the adaptation principle, we’re likely to adapt to what we set for ourselves. Luxuries and other goods adapt completely while some other “purchases” are less subject to:                          Spending more time with friends and family.              Reducing commuting time even if it means living in smaller houses.              Taking longer vacations even if it means earning less.              Programming Ruby, building Basecamp, writing for Signal v Noise, taking pictures, and enjoying all the same avenues of learning and entertainment my already privileged lifestyle had afforded me for years in advance.                                            V are things that we choose to do, not that we have to, such as meditation, exercise, learning new things and so on.          We can increase our happiness if we use your strengths, particularly in the service of strengthening connections such as helping friends, expressing gratitude to benefactors.      According to the progress principle, pleasure comes more from making progress toward a goal than from achieving them. That said, we should take the initiative and perform gratifying activities regularly.

            "content_text": "  How testosterone is made:          Sub-types of testosterone:                  Free: purest form with no protein attached, has the most benefits though only makes up 2-3% of our total testosterone          SHBG-bound: help regulating the amount of free testosterone, biologically inactive (our bodies can’t use this type of testosterone to help build muscles or boost our mood), makes up 40-50% of our total testosterone          Albumin-bound: stabilize extra-cellular fluid volumes, also biologically inactive though can be easily broken in order to create free testosterone when needed                    A small percentage of testosterone is made in the adrenal glands on top of our kidneys, but 95% of it is made in our testicles.        Testosterone deficiency downsides:          Men suffering from depression typically have low T level.      As the T level decreases, the body’s ability to regulate insulin decreases, causes fat to accumulate, put one at higher risk for type 2 diabetes.      Low libido and erectile dysfunction are two of the first signs of low testosterone.      Low testosterone levels to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease as well as the cognitive ability issues (memory loss, trouble concentrating, fogginess).        The keys to increasing testosterone level naturally are eating better, exercising smarter, and getting more sleep.          Eat more high-fat foods.                  Higher fat and cholesterol consumption results in increased levels of total T.          High protein and low carb could cause the T level to decrease.          Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage remove estrogens that lower our T.          Author’s diet (40% carb, 30% protein, 30% fats):                          Breakfast: three slices of bacon and three whole eggs              Lunch: salad mix: meat (the fattier the better), Brazil nuts/walnuts, avocados/olives, spinach, broccoli              Dinner: whatever though try to get as much as carb from veggie and fruit                                          If you want to take supplements, consider vitamin D3 and omega3 fish oil, though they only help a bit.      Exercise regularly.                  Strength training: Starting Strength, 5/3/1 program.          HIIT training.          Don’t overtrain (3-4 times a week is good), move more instead.                    Get better sleep.                  If you don’t have “morning wood” on a consistent basis, you might have low T.          If you’re not getting enough quality sleep, your body can’t produce testosterone as efficiently or effectively.          Try to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep consistently.                    Manage stress.                  Go for long walk.          Practice deep breathing exercise.                    Avoid xenoestrogens chemicals by using organic products.      Have more sex.

Used to learn anything: papers, books, talks, conversations, facts, plans,…  Have desktop client for entering new card, mobile client for reviewing.  Read a research paper in an unfamiliar field - AlphaGo paper.          Read quickly first, come up with questions that:                  Identify the most important ideas.          Look for basics fact that I could understand easily.                    Make several passes this way, each time try to get deeper, continue to ask questions.

The importance of long-term memory.          A study shows that chess grandmaster has higher memory capacity.                  Beginner see a series of individual pieces.          Master see see a “chunk”-combinations of pieces recognized as a unit -&gt; able to reason much easier at a higher level of abstraction (25k-100k).                    A study shows that the better working memory one has, the higher their IQ and vice versa.      Having more chunks memorized in some domain is somewhat like an effective boost to a person’s IQ in that domain.        Distribute practice - why Anki works?          Memory decays through time - we will forget things eventually.      Retest/recall will slow the decay - meaning it takes longer after subsequent recalls.
