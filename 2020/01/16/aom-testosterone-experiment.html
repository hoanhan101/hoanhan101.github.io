Testosterone deficiency downsides: Men suffering from depression typically have low T level. As the T level decreases, the body’s ability to regulate insulin decreases, causes fat to accumulate, put one at higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Low libido and erectile dysfunction are two of the first signs of low testosterone. Low testosterone levels to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease as well as the cognitive ability issues (memory loss, trouble concentrating, fogginess). The keys to increasing testosterone level naturally are eating better, exercising smarter, and getting more sleep. Eat more high-fat foods. Higher fat and cholesterol consumption results in increased levels of total T. High protein and low carb could cause the T level to decrease. Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage remove estrogens that lower our T. Author’s diet (40% carb, 30% protein, 30% fats): Breakfast: three slices of bacon and three whole eggs Lunch: salad mix: meat (the fattier the better), Brazil nuts/walnuts, avocados/olives, spinach, broccoli Dinner: whatever though try to get as much as carb from veggie and fruit If you want to take supplements, consider vitamin D3 and omega3 fish oil, though they only help a bit. Exercise regularly. Strength training: Starting Strength, 5/3/1 program. HIIT training. Don’t overtrai (3-4 times a week is good), move more instead. Get better sleep. If you don’t have “morning wood” on a consistent basis, you might have low T. If you’re not getting enough quality sleep, your body can’t produce testosterone as efficiently or effectively. Try to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep consistently. Manage stress. Go for long walk. Practice deep breathing exercise. Avoid xenoestrogens chemicals by using organic products. Have more sex. Take cold bath." /><meta property="og:description" content="How testosterone is made: Sub-types of testosterone: Free: purest form with no protein attached, has the most benefits though only makes up 2-3% of our total testosterone SHBG-bound: help regulating the amount of free testosterone, biologically inactive (our bodies can’t use this type of testosterone to help build muscles or boost our mood), makes up 40-50% of our total testosterone Albumin-bound: stabilize extra-cellular fluid volumes, also biologically inactive though can be easily broken in order to create free testosterone when needed A small percentage of testosterone is made in the adrenal glands on top of our kidneys, but 95% of it is made in our testicles.
