real-time</li><li>Common reasons for system failures<ul><li>Software crashes</li><li>Hardware crashes</li><li>Human error</li><li>Planned downtime</li></ul></li><li>A common way to add more availability is to have redundancy - duplicating the components &amp; keeping them on standby to take over in case the active instances go down</li></ul></li><li>Monolithic &amp; Microservices<ul><li>Monolithic: entire application code in a single service<ul><li>Pros: simple to develop, test, deploy as everything resides in one repo</li><li>Cons:<ul><li>Continuous deployment means re-deploying the entire application</li><li>Single point of failure</li><li>Hard to scale</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Microservices: tasks are split into separate services forming a larger service as a whole<ul><li>Pros:<ul><li>No single point of failure</li><li>Easier to scale independently</li></ul></li><li>Cons:<ul><li>Difficult to manage</li><li>No strong consistency</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Database<ul><li>Forms of data:<ul><li>Structured: conforms to a certain structure, stored in a normalized fashion</li><li>Unstructured: no definite structure, could be text, image, video, multimedia files, machine-generated data</li><li>Semi-structured: mix of structured and unstructured data, stored in XML or JSON</li><li>User state: user logs and activity on the platform</li></ul></li><li>Why the need for NoSQL while relational database is still doing fine?<ul><li>Scaling relational database is not trivial, which requires Sharding or Replicating</li><li>NoSQL is fast with read-write and really easy to scale out</li><li>Eventual consistency over strong consistency<ul><li>Eventual consistency: achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made, return the last updated value for all accesses</li><li>Strong consistency: data has to be strongly consistent at all times</li></ul></li><li>Data analytics</li></ul></li><li>Polyglot persistence<ul><li>Use different storage technologies to handle different needs within a given software application</li><li>Multi-model databases reduce the operational complexity of using several different database models in an application by supporting multiple data models via a single API</li></ul></li><li>CAP theorem<ul><li>It is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:<ul><li>Consistency: every read receives the most recent write</li><li>Availability: every request receives a non-error response</li><li>Partition tolerance: system continues to operate despite network failures</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Types of databases<ul><li>Document-oriented: generally semi-structured &amp; stored in a JSON-like format<ul><li>Use cases:<ul><li>Working with semi-structured
