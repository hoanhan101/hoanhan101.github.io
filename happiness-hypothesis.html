Each person has a characteristic level of happiness that each is born with. It’s not a set point but a range. The challenge is to understand C and V in order to push H to the top of the range. The 2 biggest parts of C are love and pursuing the right goals. We are social creatures in a sense that we can’t be happy without having friends and secure attachments. To love well is to have good relationships with other people. The right goals are ones that produce states of flow and engagement. Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness. According to the adaptation principle, we’re likely to adapt to what we set for ourselves. Luxuries and other goods adapt completely while some other “purchases” are less subject to: Spending more time with friends and family. Reducing commuting time even if it means living in smaller houses. Taking longer vacations even if it means earning less. Programming Ruby, building Basecamp, writing for Signal v Noise, taking pictures, and enjoying all the same avenues of learning and entertainment my already privileged lifestyle had afforded me for years in advance. V are things that we choose to do, not that we have to, such as meditation, exercise, learning new things and so on. We can increase our happiness if we use your strengths, particularly in the service of strengthening connections such as helping friends, expressing gratitude to benefactors. According to the progress principle, pleasure comes more from making progress toward a goal than from achieving them. That said, we should take the initiative and perform gratifying activities regularly." /><meta property="og:description" content="Happiness (H) = S (Biological happiness set point) + C (Life conditions) + V (Voluntary activities).
