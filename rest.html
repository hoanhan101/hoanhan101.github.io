Rest is an essential component of good work as world-class people alternate daily periods of intense work and concentration with long breaks. Rest is active since the brain doesn’t switch off when we go to sleep but get busy doing work such as consolidating memories, reviewing the day. Rest is a skill. People don’t just become world class only by deliberate practice. They also practice deliberate rest. Deliberate rest stimulates and sustain creativity. Many notable creatives do their most intense work in the morning, go on walks, takes nap during the days, allow their subconscious mind to wander and explore. Other shows consistency in habits and hobbies. People don’t view rest properly. Science is now full of political power and competition. One has to go fast so there is no time to concentrate for a long period of time. Most scientists assume that long hours are required to produce great work. We treat modern workaholic as heroes. Mind wandering is necessary for creativity. A long break after hours of intense focus can help one see the problem better. 4 stages of a thought: Preparation: immerse in the problem, get familiar with all its parts, examine from every angle, must be so fluent with the work that subconscious can play with it Incubation: let the mind wander, do not force it, trust that your unconscious will drive you to the next phase Illumination: aha moment, the answer bursts into consciousness, suddenly, like an inspiration Verification: set the solution on a logical foundation, fill in the details or fit it into a bigger project To treat incubation and illumination like skill every day, develop and refine daily routines and practice that preserve time for mind-wandering. Get up to 4 hours of really focused, serious work everyday. Practice hardest and longest in the morning. Take a nap/walk/break in the afternoon to stretch out the day (increase alertness, decrease fatigue, improve memory). Have a second practice in the late afternoon or evening. Try to work at the exact same time and make it a routine. Stop working at the right point, just to see the next move but leave it until tomorrow. Give subconscious free time to work to provide time for incubation and illumination. Provide a chain for the brain to recover some of the energy it had previously expended. Make it easier to get back into the rhythm when you resume the next day. Other than taking breaks during the day, the ability to put work completely out of your mind and attend other things is just as important. A number of scientists have been noted athletes, competed in several competitions and won many medals. Essentially, not only they’re world-class at their jobs, they’re also killing the sport game. Not only exercising makes the brain healthier by reducing cholesterol and improving cardiovascular capacity, it introduces profound structural brain plasticity. It stimulates neurogenesis. Has indirect but positive effects on creativity. Some scientists are also avid musicians, practice different art forms such as performing, dancing, poetry and so on. Participate in deep play. It’s an activity that rewarding on its own, but take on additional layers of meaning and personal significance. It’s mentally absorbing by offering player challenges to solve. Offers players a new context in which to use some of the same skill that they use in their work. Offers the same satisfaction as work and also clearer rewards. Provides a living connection to the player’s past. Popular forms of deep play: Albert Michelson, first American to win a Nobel Prize (in Physics in 1907), took up tennis, becoming one of the first Americans to master a topspin stroke.
