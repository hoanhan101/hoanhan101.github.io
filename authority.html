To find a topic, ask yourself what people ask you for help with. You don’t have to be an expert to teach, though there are ways to establish expertise: Join official-sounding organizations. Talk about top-rated books on your topic. Write for other leading publication. Two main factors decide if your book is successful are: Does it teach a skill that people use to make money so that they can make more than they spend? Do they gather in any online communities that you can reach? Competition shows there is a market, a need. Make consistent progress everyday. Don’t break the chain. Self publish so you don’t have to depend on any firm. Basic marketing: A good way to market your book is to build up your audience by teaching. Before spending months writing, test the demand by creating a landing page and telling people about it. Have 3 good blog posts to demonstrate your expertise if you don’t have ones yet. Use email list to build your audience since social media can be distracting. Don’t let your list die by simply keep providing valuable content every week or every few weeks. Pricing and packaging: Price on 2 main factors: value delivered and your goals. The more value delivered, the higher the price. If your goal is to build a huge audience, a low price makes sense as more copies would be sold (hopefully). Use packages to charge more for more delivered value: Video tutorials Explanation screencasts Interviews Code samples Courses Workshops Prepping for launch: Once you have a landing page, stay contact with your subscribers once every week or two. Get them excited about the incoming book. Gradually drip out a sample chapter, the book outline, other quotes… Try to be everywhere on the launch day by writing for other publications. Start building up a relationship slowly by helping them in some ways. Affiliates also work, though be selective since only a few affiliates can sell well. Give free preview copies and ask for feedbacks and testimonials. The sale page: Focus on the pain. Talk to your customers and find out exactly what their pains are. Write them in a list and for each one, explain how your methods for overcoming each one. Basic elements: Why should someone care A sample chapter Table of contents Social proof (testimonials, featured projects,…) About the author Listing your packages Purchase options FAQ (file types, refund policy, skill-level expectations) E-commerce: Pros of Kindle and iBook: Support multiple platforms out of the box. Getting setup is easy. Indexed and searchable via popular search engines Cons: Pricing cut Control of subscribers Good alternatives include GumRoad, E-junkie, Space Box. Launch day and beyond: Make sure your subscribers are clear about the launch date the day before. Make it easy to share by including sample tweets. Make sure your scheduled guest posts go live today. When sales drop, keep teaching and giving content away for free." /><meta property="og:description" content="On writing: Most well-known people in the industry share and teach things that they know, either through speaking or writing.
